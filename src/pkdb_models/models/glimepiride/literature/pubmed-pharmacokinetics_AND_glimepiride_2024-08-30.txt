AB  - Glimepiride (GLIM) is used as an oral antihyperglycemic agent for treatment of 
      type 2 diabetes. The drug presents two polymorphic forms (GLIM form I and GLIM 
      form II) described in the literature, and according to in vitro data, GLIM form 
      II is about 3.5 times more soluble and releases 2 times the drug amount than GLIM 
      form I in the physiological pH range. Considering the literature in vitro data 
      and that the diabetes treatment demands glycemic control, avoiding abrupt 
      fluctuations in the blood glucose levels, this work aimed to study the impact of 
      GLIM polymorphism in the in vivo performance of GLIM solid oral dosages. For 
      this, hard gelatin capsules with GLIM form I or II were prepared and orally 
      administered in rats. After that, pharmacokinetic studies were performed by 
      sampling animal blood at different times, and biochemical parameters 
      (pharmacodynamic), such as glucose and insulin, were also evaluated. Our results 
      showed that the in vitro data corroborate with our in vivo assays. GLIM form II 
      provided higher plasma concentration of drug than form I (at baseline up to 
      approximately 200 min after oral administration) and, consequently, increased 
      insulin release and reduced levels of glucose, showing good correlation between 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics assays. Thus, this study demonstrated that 
      GLIM polymorphs in oral dosages might alter the drug efficacy, which may expose 
      the patients to risks, such as hypoglycemia.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sulfonylureas have been the standard second-line treatment after 
      failure of metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) but they 
      are becoming less popular as the newer glucose-lowering agents have a relatively 
      lower risk of hypoglycemia and some of them have been shown to reduce 
      cardiovascular and renal events. Gliclazide differs from other sulfonylureas in 
      several respects and may provide a suitable option for some patients with T2D. 
      AREAS COVERED: In this article, we review the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics 
      and clinical efficacy of gliclazide based on the available literature. EXPERT 
      OPINION: Gliclazide in the modified release (MR) formulation given once daily 
      provides a good 24-h glycemic efficacy comparable to most other groups of glucose 
      lowering drugs. Hypoglycemic events are less frequent than with some other 
      sulfonylureas, and weight gain is not a major problem. Cardiovascular outcome 
      studies have shown no evidence of increased cardiovascular events with 
      gliclazide, and the durability of glucose lowering effects is comparable to other 
      drug groups. Lower doses of gliclazide appear to have an incretin-enhancing 
      effect, and overall it can provide a cost-effective treatment that is useful in 
      many patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditional medicinal herbs are widely consumed in developing 
      countries to treat diabetes as they are perceived to be safer, less expensive, 
      and have fewer side effects as compared to the conventional medicines. Diabecon 
      (DB), Himalaya Herbal Healthcare, India is herbal over-the-counter formulation 
      which contains several herbs that are reported in the traditional texts for the 
      treatment of diabetes. The majority of these herbs have been investigated and 
      found to interfere with the cytochrome pathway. The most common oral 
      antihyperglycemic drug used today in clinical practice is Glimepiride (GP).The 
      CYP2C9 enzyme is mainly responsible for the metabolism of GP. Herein we 
      hypothesize that the co-administration of GP with DB may result in possible 
      Herb-Drug Interactions (HDIs) as DB has the potential to significantly inhibit 
      the CYP2C9 enzyme. OBJECTIVE: In the current study, the pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic interactions of GP (0.82 mg/kg) with DB (110.95 mg/kg) was 
      investigated in diabetes induced (Nicotinamide-STZ) rats by co-administering both 
      drugs orally for 21 days. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the study of the HDI, 
      Bioanalytical RP-HPLC/PDA method for quantifying GP in plasma of rats was 
      developed and validated as per US-FDA guidelines. In vivo pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic parameters were studied on day 1 and day 21 post administration. 
      RESULTS: The RP-HPLC/PDA method was successfully employed for quantification of 
      GP in the PK studies. The co-administration of GP and DB in diabetic rats 
      resulted in beneficial pharmacodynamic interactions, but there were no notable 
      changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters of GP. CONCLUSION: This current 
      investigation in an animal model suggests that co-administration of GP and DB may 
      have significant therapeutic benefits in the treatment of diabetes; however, 
      additional research, randomized clinical trials or case studies in humans, is 
      needed.

TI  - Effects of fluconazole and fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of glimepiride.
PG  - 194-200
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to study the effects of fluconazole and fluvoxamine 
      on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glimepiride, a new sulfonylurea 
      antidiabetic drug. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, three-phase 
      crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers took 200 mg of fluconazole once daily (400 
      mg on day 1), 100 mg of fluvoxamine once daily, or placebo once daily for 4 days. 
      On day 4, a single oral dose of 0.5 mg of glimepiride was administered. Plasma 
      glimepiride and blood glucose concentrations were measured up to 12 hours. 
      RESULTS: In the fluconazole phase, the mean total area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve of glimepiride was 238% (P <.0001) and the peak plasma 
      concentration was 151% (P <.0001) of the respective control value. The mean 
      elimination half-life of glimepiride was prolonged from 2.0 to 3.3 hours (P 
      <.0001) by fluconazole. In the fluvoxamine phase, the mean area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve of glimepiride was not significantly different from that 
      in the placebo phase. However, the mean peak plasma concentration of glimepiride 
      was 143% (P <.05) of the control and the elimination half-life was prolonged from 
      2.0 to 2.3 hours (P <.01) by fluvoxamine. Fluconazole and fluvoxamine did not 
      cause statistically significant changes in the effects of glimepiride on blood 
      glucose concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Fluconazole considerably increased the area 
      under the plasma concentration-time curve of glimepiride and prolonged its 
      elimination half-life. This was probably caused by inhibition of the cytochrome 
      P-450 2C9-mediated biotransformation of glimepiride by fluconazole. Concomitant 
      use of fluconazole with glimepiride may increase the risk of hypoglycemia as much 
      as would a 2- to 3-fold increase in the dose of glimepiride. Fluvoxamine 
      moderately increased the plasma concentrations and slightly prolonged the 
      elimination half-life of glimepiride.

PG  - 591-5
AB  - AIMS: To study the effects of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmaco-dynamics of glimepiride, a new sulphonylurea antidiabetic drug. METHODS: 
      In this randomised, two-phase cross-over study, 10 healthy volunteers were 
      treated for 5 days with 600 mg rifampicin or placebo once daily. On day 6, a 
      single oral dose of 1 mg glimepiride was administered. Plasma glimepiride and 
      blood glucose concentrations were measured up to 12 h. RESULTS: Rifampicin 
      decreased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve of glimepiride 
      by 34% (P < 0.001) and the mean elimination half-life by 25% (P < 0.05). No 
      significant differences in the blood glucose response to glimepiride were 
      observed between the placebo and rifampicin phases. However, symptomatic 
      hypoglycaemia occurred only during the placebo phase. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of 
      rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride suggest that rifampicin induced 
      the CYP2C9-mediated metabolism of glimepiride and thereby slightly increased its 
      systemic clearance. Because the interaction was modest and did not significantly 
      alter the glucose-lowering effect of glimepiride in healthy volunteers, it is 
      probably of limited clinical significance. However, in some patients the 
      hypoglycaemic effect of glimepiride may be reduced during concomitant treatment 
      with rifampicin.

TI  - Glyburide and glimepiride pharmacokinetics in subjects with different CYP2C9 
      genotypes.
PG  - 326-32
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to investigate the effects of genetic polymorphisms 
      of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 on the pharmacokinetics of glyburide (INN, 
      glibenclamide) and glimepiride, two widely used sulfonylurea antidiabetic drugs. 
      METHODS: We conducted CYP2C9 genotyping for 29 healthy volunteers who had 
      participated in our previous pharmacokinetic studies on glyburide or glimepiride. 
      RESULTS: There were 17 subjects (59%) with the CYP2C9*1/*1 (wild-type) genotype, 
      8 (28%) with the CYP2C9*1/*2 genotype, 3 (10%) with the CYP2C9*1/*3 genotype, and 
      1 (3%) with the CYP2C9*2/*3 genotype. The pharmacokinetics of glyburide or 
      glimepiride were not significantly changed among subjects with the CYP2C9*1/*2 
      genotype. However, in individuals heterozygous for the CYP2C9*3 allele, the 
      median total area under the plasma concentration-time curve of glyburide (n = 2) 
      was 280% (P < or = .05) and that of glimepiride (n = 3) was 267% (P < or = .01) 
      of the respective values in subjects with the CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype (n = 5 and n = 
      12, respectively). Blood glucose responses to glyburide and glimepiride were not 
      significantly affected by the CYP2C9 genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic polymorphisms 
      of CYP2C9 markedly affect the pharmacokinetics of both glyburide and glimepiride. 
      The influence of the CYP2C9*3 variant allele on glyburide and glimepiride 
      pharmacokinetics may be clinically significant.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and safety of glimepiride at clinically effective doses in 
      diabetic patients with renal impairment.
PG  - 1617-24
AB  - The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of glimepiride were investigated in a 
      single- and a multiple-dose open study in patients with non-insulin-dependent 
      diabetes mellitus and renal impairment and an initial creatinine clearance above 
      10 ml/ min. Patients were divided into three groups with creatinine clearance 
      above 50 ml/min, 20-50 ml/min and under 20 ml/min. Fifteen fasting patients 
      received a single dose of 3 mg glimepiride and serial blood and urine samples 
      were taken over 24 h for pharmacokinetic and efficacy analyses. A further 16 
      patients received glimepiride over a 3-month period, an initial dose of 1 mg 
      glimepiride being adjusted within the range 1 to 8 mg to achieve good glucose 
      control. Pharmacokinetic evaluation was done on day 1 and after 3 months. Mean 
      relative total clearance and mean volume of distribution of both single (41.6 ml/ 
      min and 8.47 litres, respectively, when creatinine clearance was above 50 ml/min) 
      and multiple doses of glimepiride increased in proportion to the degree of renal 
      impairment (to 91.1 ml/min and 14.98 litres, respectively, when creatinine 
      clearance was below 20 ml/min, single dose), whereas the terminal halflife and 
      mean time remained unchanged. Lower relative total clearance and renal clearance 
      of both glimepiride metabolites correlated significantly with lower creatinine 
      clearance values. Of the 16 patients 12 required between 1 and 4 mg glimepiride 
      to stabilize their fasting blood glucose. Glimepiride was well-tolerated and 
      there were no drug-related adverse events. In conclusion glimepiride is safe, 
      effective and has clearly-definable pharmacokinetics in diabetic patients with 
      renal impairment. The increased plasma elimination of glimepiride with decreasing 
      kidney function is explainable on the basis of altered protein binding with an 
      increase in unbound drug.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glimepiride in type 2 diabetic patients: 
      compared effects of once- versus twice-daily dosing.
PG  - 571-6
AB  - To compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of glimepiride between 
      once- and twice-daily dosing in type 2 diabetic patients. Eight Japanese type 2 
      diabetic patients, who had been treated with 2 mg glimepiride alone over 4 weeks 
      (age 40-70, body mass index <or=25 kg/m2, hemoglobin A 1C<8.0%), were randomly 
      assigned to the crossover study with glimepiride 2 mg once-daily and 1 mg 
      twice-daily for 4 weeks for each regime. Serum concentrations of glimepiride, 
      plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptide were measured over 24 h at the fixed time 
      intervals on the last day of each crossover period, and HbA 1C was measured at 
      the same day. Pharmacokinetic profiles in two regimens were different to each 
      others; a single peak of serum glimepiride concentration was observed in 
      once-daily, and double peaks in twice-daily dosing. Drug concentration increased 
      immediately, and peaked at 2 h after administration irrespective of dosage. Cmax 
      value in once-daily dose was higher than those in twice-daily doses. AUC values 
      were not different between two regimens. Pharmacodynamic profiles for plasma 
      glucoses, serum insulin and C-peptide showed no statistically significant 
      differences between two regimens, and parameters were not different each other. 
      Analyses of adverse events and laboratory data demonstrated a favorable safety 
      profile of glimepiride. The present results suggest that glimepiride may be 
      suitable for once-daily dosing with respect to clinical usefulness.

TI  - Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Antihyperglycemic Medications 
      in Children and Adolescents with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
PG  - 561-571
LID - 10.1007/s40262-016-0472-6 [doi]
AB  - The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among children and adolescents 
      has been rising. This condition is associated with obesity, and it's prevalence 
      is higher among minority or female youth. Lifestyle modification including diet 
      and exercise is only successful in a small proportion of patients; therefore, 
      pharmacotherapy approaches are needed to treat T2DM among youth. Currently, in 
      the USA, only metformin and insulin are approved for the treatment of T2DM in 
      children. However, several antihyperglycemic agents including exenatide, 
      glimepiride, glyburide, liraglutide, pioglitazone, and rosiglitazone are also 
      used off-label in this population. Moreover, a number of clinical trials are 
      ongoing that are aimed at addressing the safety and efficacy of newer 
      antihyperglycemic agents in this population. Little is known about the safety, 
      efficacy, or pharmacokinetics of antihyperglycemic agents in children or 
      adolescents. Our ability to predict the pharmacokinetics of these agents in youth 
      is hampered first by the lack of information about the expression and activity of 
      drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters in this population and second by the 
      presence of comorbid conditions such as obesity and fatty liver disease. This 
      article reviews the prevalence of obesity and T2DM in children and adolescents 
      (youth). We then summarize published studies on safety and effectiveness of 
      antihyperglycemic medications in youth. Drug disposition may be affected by age 
      or puberty and thus the expression and activity of different pathways for drug 
      metabolism and xenobiotic transporters are compared between youth and adults 
      followed by a summary of pharmacokinetics studies of antihyperglycemic agents 
      currently used in this population.

      Glimepiride in Presence of (Vimto(®)) Soft Drinks in Rats: Application to 
      Pharmacokinetics Studies.
PG  - 49-59
LID - 10.4103/jpbs.JPBS_200_18 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Diet and beverages are thought to have notable effects on drugs. 
      Recently, this relationship has received significant consideration. AIMS: To 
      develop and validate a simple, rapid, and sensitive method for the determination 
      of glimepiride in rat serum. This will be performed using high-performance liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Potential pharmacokinetic 
      interactions between glimepiride and the soft drink, Vimto, will also be 
      investigated in the serum of experimental rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HPLC-MS/MS 
      was constructed and clarithromycin was used as an internal standard. RESULTS: The 
      method was validated in terms of linearity, precision, accuracy, stability, and 
      system suitability parameters. The method was found to be satisfactory and 
      suitable for the determination of glimepiride. The precision of glimepiride was 
      high (coefficient of variation, CV% <15%), the accuracy over all 3 days of 
      validation was within the accepted criteria. Glimepiride peak serum concentration 
      (C (max)) was 126.01 ng/mL and was reached within 1 h (T (max)) of 
      administration. Mean area under curve (AUC) was 964.70 ng/mL and was reached 
      within 24 h of administration. The Vimto soft drink significantly (P < 0.050) 
      reduced glimepiride peak serum concentration to 57.87 ng/mL and was reached 
      within 2 h of administration. AUC was significantly reduced to 335.04 ng(*)h/mL 
      (P < 0.050). CONCLUSION: Glimepiride pharmacokinetic parameters such as C (max) 
      and AUC were significantly affected by the Vimto soft drink. Therefore, this 
      study developed a simple, rapid, and sensitive method for validation and 
      determination of the effects of soft drinks on drugs using the LC-MS/MS method.

AB  - Ipragliflozin (Suglat(®)) is a potent and selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter-2 that was recently launched in Japan. Its mechanism of action 
      involves the suppression of glucose re-absorption in the kidney proximal tubules, 
      causing excretion of glucose in the urine. The aim of this review is to provide a 
      comprehensive overview of currently available pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      data on ipragliflozin, including studies in healthy subjects, patients with type 
      2 diabetes mellitus and special populations. In single- and multiple-dose 
      studies, the maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) for ipragliflozin increased in a dose-dependent 
      manner. Although urinary excretion of ipragliflozin is low (approximately 1 %), 
      tubular concentration of free ipragliflozin is adequate to provide 
      pharmacological activities. No clinically relevant effects of age, gender or food 
      on the exposure of ipragliflozin were observed. The AUC for ipragliflozin was 
      20-30 % greater in patients with moderate renal or hepatic impairment than in 
      patients with normal renal or hepatic function. In drug-drug interaction studies, 
      the pharmacokinetics of ipragliflozin and other oral antidiabetic drugs 
      (metformin, sitagliptin, pioglitazone, glimepiride, miglitol and mitiglinide) 
      were not significantly affected by their co-administration. Urinary glucose 
      excretion (UGE) also increased in a dose-dependent manner, approaching a maximum 
      effect at 50-100 mg dosages in Japanese healthy volunteers and patients with type 
      2 diabetes. The change in UGE from baseline (ΔUGE) tended to be lower in older 
      subjects and female subjects, compared with younger subjects and male subjects, 
      respectively. ΔUGE tended to decrease with decreasing renal function, especially 
      in patients with type 2 diabetes with moderate or severe renal impairment.

TI  - Effect of piperine on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glimepiride in 
      normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.
PG  - 1283-6
AB  - The effect of piperine on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
      glimepiride in normal as well as diabetic rats was studied. In normal and 
      streptozotocin induced diabetic rats the combination of glimepiride with piperine 
      increased all the pharmacokinetic parameters, such as Cmax, AUC0-n, AUCtotal, 
      t1/2, and MRT, and decreased the clearance, Vd, markedly as compared with the 
      control group. In pharmacodynamic studies, the combination of glimepiride with 
      piperine provided significant protection against the diabetes induced alterations 
      in the biochemical parameters. In addition, the combination of glimepiride with 
      piperine also improved the total antioxidant status significantly in diabetic 
      rats compared with piperine and glimepiride treated groups. The results revealed 
      that a combination of glimepiride with piperine led to the enhancement of the 
      bioavailability of glimepiride by inhibiting the CYP2C9 enzyme, which suggested 
      that piperine might be beneficial as an adjuvant to glimepiride in a proper dose, 
      in diabetic patients.

TI  - Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction of losartan with 
      glimepiride-metformin combination in rats and rabbits.
PG  - 465-470
LID - 10.4103/ijp.IJP_845_19 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The presence of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, 
      peripheral vascular disease, and chronic renal disease, or and the prevention of 
      these ailments in diabetics, frequently demands multiple drug treatments, 
      increasing the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). The current study was 
      focused on identifying possible DDIs on concomitant administration of losartan, a 
      drug used to regulate hypertension along with a combination of glimepiride + 
      metformin, widely used to treat diabetes mellitus. Possible pharmacodynamic and 
      pharmacokinetic interactions were observed for, following single-dose as well as 
      multiple-dose treatment protocols in normal and alloxan-induced diabetes in 
      albino Wistar rats and rabbits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples from 
      surviving rats/rabbits obtained through orbital venous sinus bleeding/marginal 
      ear vein bleeding, respectively, at predetermined intervals and put through to 
      biochemical estimations of sugar level in the blood by Glucose oxidase/peroxidase 
      method; insulin levels in serum using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and 
      serum glimepiride levels using the high-performance liquid chromatography. 
      RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Losartan, when treated as a single drug, resulted in a 
      slight lowering of blood glucose levels in normal rats, diabetic rats and normal 
      rabbits. Hypoglycemic activity of a combination of glimepiride + metformin was 
      enhanced when losartan was co-administered as a single dosage schedule as well as 
      a multiple dose schedule as indicated by a reduced blood glucose level and 
      enhanced levels of insulin in rats as well as in rabbits. Serum glimepiride 
      levels were also higher and pharmacokinetic parameters of glimepiride including 
      mean residence time, C(max), T(1/2), AUMC(0-∞), AUMC(0-t), and AUC(0-∞), were 
      significantly higher, whereas its clearance was decreased in the two regimens of 
      losartan that was followed. CONCLUSION: It can therefore be concluded, that in 
      diabetics with hypertension as a comorbidity condition, co-administration of 
      losartan with glimepiride + metformin should be avoided or the dosage of a 
      combination of glimepiride + metformin needs to be tittered to avoid recurrence 
      of hypoglycemic episodes.

AB  - Gymnema sylvestre, important Indian traditional herbal medicine has been used for 
      diabetes from several years and marketed as single or multi-herb formulations 
      globally. People are consuming G. sylvestre along with conventional hypoglycemic 
      drugs. Therefore, there is need of evidence based assessment of risk versus 
      benefits when G. sylvestre co-administered with conventional oral hypoglycemic 
      drugs. In present investigation, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic 
      interactions with oral hypoglycemic drug, glimepiride (GLM) was studied in 
      streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats. A specific and rapid HPLC-ESI-MS/MS 
      method was established for simultaneous quantification of GLM and gymnemagenin 
      (GMG) in rat plasma. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction studies were 
      carried out in STZ induced diabetic rats after concomitant administration of 
      400 mg/kg of G. sylvestre extract and 0.8 mg/kg of GLM for 28 days. The developed 
      HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method was rapid, specific, and precise. Con-comitant oral 
      administration of G. sylvestre extract (400 mg/kg) and GLM (0.8 mg/kg) in 
      diabetic rats for 28 days showed beneficial pharmacodynamic interactions whereas 
      no major alterations in the pharmacokinetics parameters of GLM and GMG were 
      observed. This interaction demonstrated in animal model implies that significant 
      clinical outcome might occur during concomitant administration of G. sylvestre 
      extract and GLM especially in diabetic patients and warrants further studies in 
      the same set up.

AB  - The therapeutic use of glimepiride and gliclazide shows substantial 
      inter-individual variation in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in human 
      populations, which might be caused by genetic differences among individuals. The 
      aim of this study was to assess the effect of CYP2C9 and OATP1B1 genetic 
      polymorphisms on the metabolism and transport of glimepiride and gliclazide. The 
      uptake of glimepiride and gliclazide was measured in OATP1B1*1a, *5 and 
      *15-HEK293T cells, and their metabolism was measured using CYP2C9*1, *2 and *3 
      recombinase by LC-MS. Glimepiride in OATP1B1*1a, *5 and *15-HEK293T cells had 
      V(max) values of 155 ± 18.7, 80 ± 9.6, and 84.5 ± 8.2 pmol/min/mg, while 
      gliclazide had V(max) values of 15.7 ± 4.6, 7.2 ± 2.5, and 8.7 ± 2.4 pmol/min/mg, 
      respectively. The clearance of glimepiride and gliclazide in OATP1B1*5 and *15 
      was significantly reduced compared to the wild-type. Glimepiride in the presence 
      of CYP2C9*1, *2 and *3 recombinase had V(max) values of 21.58 ± 7.78, 
      15.69 ± 5.59, and 9.17 ± 3.03 nmol/min/mg protein, while gliclazide had V(max) 
      values of 15.73 ± 3.11, 10.53 ± 4.06, and 6.21 ± 2.94 nmol/min/mg protein, 
      respectively. The clearance of glimepiride and gliclazide in CYP2C9*2 and *3 was 
      significantly reduced compared to the wild-type. These findings collectively 
      indicate that OATP1B1*5 and *15 and CYP2C9*2 and *3 have a significant effect on 
      the transport and metabolism of glimepiride and gliclazide.

TI  - Frequency of CYP2C9 variant alleles, including CYP2C9*13 in a Korean population 
      and effect on glimepiride pharmacokinetics.
PG  - 105-11

AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 is a clinically important 
      enzyme involved in the metabolism of many drugs commonly used in humans. Of 
      several allelic variants known to affect the catalytic activity of the CYP2C9 
      enzyme, the frequencies of the CYP2C9*3 and CYP2C9*13 alleles in the Korean 
      population have been reported as 1·1% and 0·6%, respectively. Our objective was 
      to re-evaluate the frequencies of CYP2C9 allelic variants in the Korean 
      population, including the CYP2C9*13 allele by pyrosequencing, and to investigate 
      the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride in relation to CYP2C9 genotypes, including 
      CYP2C9*3/*3. METHODS: 295 subjects were genotyped for CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 using 
      the TaqMan procedure, and for CYP2C9*13 using pyrosequencing. These data were 
      combined with our previously reported data to assess the CYP2C9 allele and 
      genotype frequencies in 869 Korean subjects. Data from 24 of the 295 genotyped 
      subjects (22 CYP2C9*1/*1 homozygotes, one CYP2C9*1/*3 heterozygote and one 
      CYP2C9*3/*3 homozygote) who had participated in a bioequivalence study were 
      analysed retrospectively to examine the effects of CYP2C9 genotype on glimepiride 
      pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: The frequencies of the CYP2C9*1/*3, *3/*3, and *1/*13 
      genotypes in the study population (n = 295) were 0·081 (n = 24), 0·010 (n = 3) 
      and 0·003 (n = 1), respectively. In the 869 subjects from the combined studies, 
      allele frequencies for CYP2C9*3 and CYP2C9*13 were 0·025 (95% CI: 0·018, 0·033) 
      and 0·002 (95% CI: 0·000, 0·010), respectively. Relative to CYP2C9*1 homozygotes, 
      the one CYP2C9*3 homozygous subject was found to have a higher AUC(0-∞) value 
      (490% of the reference value) and a lower oral clearance rate (18% of the 
      reference). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This study is the first examination of 
      CYP2C9*3 homozygotes in the Korean population. Our data on the one subject with 
      this genotype suggest that CYP2C9*3/*3 momozygotes have lower clearance of 
      glimepiride and are exposed to higher levels of the drug than wild-type 
      homozygotes. Although we identified a subject with the CYP2C9*13 allele using a 
      new pyrosequencing assay, we were unfortunately unable to investigate its effects 
      on glimepiride pharmacokinetics.

TI  - Effect of gemfibrozil on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
      glimepiride.
PG  - 439-45
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to study the effects of gemfibrozil on the 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glimepiride, a new sulfonylurea 
      antidiabetic drug and a substrate of cytochrome P4502C9 (CYP2C9). METHODS: In a 
      randomized, 2-phase crossover study, 10 healthy volunteers were treated for 2 
      days with 600 mg oral gemfibrozil or placebo twice daily. On day 3, they received 
      a single dose of 600 mg gemfibrozil or placebo and 1 hour later a single dose of 
      0.5 mg glimepiride orally. Plasma glimepiride, serum insulin, and blood glucose 
      concentrations were measured up to 12 hours. RESULTS: Gemfibrozil increased the 
      mean total area under the plasma concentration-time curve of glimepiride by 23% 
      (range, 6%-56%; P <.005). The mean elimination half-life of glimepiride was 
      prolonged from 2.1 to 2.3 hours (P <.05) by gemfibrozil. No statistically 
      significant differences were found in the serum insulin or blood glucose 
      variables between the two phases. CONCLUSIONS: Gemfibrozil modestly increases the 
      plasma concentrations of glimepiride. This may be caused by inhibition of CYP2C9.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Interactions Between Evogliptin and Glimepiride 
      in Healthy Male Subjects.
PG  - 5179-5187
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S275343 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Evogliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, and glimepiride, a 
      sulfonylurea, are used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, we aimed 
      to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) interactions 
      between evogliptin and glimepiride. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized, 
      open-label, 3-period, 3-treatment, 2-sequence crossover study was conducted in 
      healthy male subjects. During each period, subjects received multiple doses of 
      evogliptin 5 mg alone (EVO), glimepiride 4 mg alone (GLI), or a combination of 
      the two (EVO+GLI). Serial blood and urine samples were collected 168 and 24 h 
      post dosing, respectively, for PK and PD analyses. RESULTS: Thirty-four subjects 
      completed the study. The co-administration of evogliptin and glimepiride did not 
      alter their plasma and urine PK profiles. For evogliptin, the geometric mean 
      ratio (GMR) (90% confidence intervals) for the maximum plasma concentrations at 
      steady-state (C(max,ss)) and the area under the curve during dosing interval at 
      steady-state (AUC(τ,ss)) of EVO+GLI to E were 1.02 (0.98-1.06) and 0.97 
      (0.95-1.00), respectively. For glimepiride, the corresponding values of EVO+GLI 
      to GLI were 1.08 (1.01-1.17) and 1.08 (1.02-1.14), respectively. All values were 
      within the regulatory bioequivalence criteria of 0.8-1.25. Glucose excursion 
      decreased with the co-administration of evogliptin and glimepiride compared with 
      that observed with the evogliptin or glimepiride monotherapy. CONCLUSION: 
      Evogliptin and glimepiride had no PK interactions when co-administered, while the 
      combination therapy showed an additive glucose-lowering effect compared to those 
      of evogliptin or glimepiride monotherapy.

      hypoglycaemic agents in people with type 2 diabetes. This review investigates the 
      impact of genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
      sulfonylurea drugs. CYP2C9 is the major enzyme involved in sulfonylurea drug 
      metabolism. CYP2C9 variant allele carriers have significant lower apparent 
      clearance of these medicines. CYP2C19 genotype is more influential for gliclazide 
      pharmacokinetics when compared to CYP2C9. Sulfonylurea pharmacodynamics is 
      affected by several genes. Sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1, ABCC8 gene) and K+ 
      inward rectifier Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) have been correlated to significant variation in 
      sulfonylurea response. Diabetics with the SUR1 exon 33 G allele are more 
      sensitive to gliclazide and the rs5210 variant of the KCNJ11 gene was associated 
      with improved clinical efficacy of gliclazide. Carriers of Transcription factor 
      7-like 2 (TCF7L2) variants are more likely to fail sulfonylurea therapy. On the 
      other hand, patients with HNF-1alpha mutations had a significant greater response 
      to gliclazide when compared to those with type 2 diabetes. The Arg972 
      polymorphism of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) may lead to secondary failure 
      of sulfonylurea therapy. Calpain 10 gene (CAPN10) polymorphism has also been 
      linked to sulfonylurea drug response. Despite the available evidence, larger 
      population studies that investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
      sulfonylurea drugs are needed to investigate the influence of key SNPs amidst all 
      potential contributing factors to variability in response to these which inturn 
      will provide information to optimise sulfonylurea use in people with diabetes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The cytochrome P4502C enzymes account for the metabolism of 
      approximately 20% of therapeutic drugs including certain oral antidiabetic drugs 
      (OADs). AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on the effect of CYP2C enzymes on 
      metabolism of sulphonylureas (SUs), meglitinides, and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) 
      discussing their impact on pharmacokinetics, drug interactions and toxicological 
      profiles. Pharmacogenetic aspects reflecting individual gene variants and 
      variable drug effects are also considered. EXPERT OPINION: Genetic polymorphisms 
      of CYP2C9 enzymes (*2/*2, *2/*3, *3/*3) influence the glycaemic response to SUs 
      and impair their substrate metabolism. Restricted data from small-sized studies 
      with heterogenous definitions of hypoglycaemia revealed no clear association 
      between CYP2C9 genotypes and the risk of hypoglycaemia. Functional polymorphisms 
      of CYP2C8- and CYP2C9 drug metabolizing genes affect markedly pharmacokinetics of 
      meglitinides. Compared to wild-type carriers, patients treated with TZDs and 
      carrying the common CYP2C8*3 and *4 variants showed a reduced glycaemic control. 
      The strong CYP2C8 and OATP1B1 inhibitor gemfibrozil increases substantially the 
      plasma concentrations of repaglinide and TZDs. Numerous metabolic drug 
      interactions exist between SUs and commonly prescribed drugs, especially 
      anti-infectives. The complex pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic properties and 
      the unfavourable short and long term risk profile of glibenclamide and 
      glimepiride raise the question whether their use can be justified any longer.

AB  - In this paper, orally nanocrystal capsules were produced using nanocrystal 
      formulations in order to optimize dissolution properties of poorly soluble drug 
      glimepiride and improve its bioavailability. The important preparation variables, 
      such as stabilizers, the power input and the time length of ultrasonication on 
      the mean particle size and polydispersity index were investigated systematically, 
      and the optimal values were 0.2% glimepiride (w/v), 1.2% Lipoid S100, 0.6% PEG 
      6000 (w/v), 0.6% PVPK 30 (w/v), 500 W and 2 min, respectively. Characterization 
      of glimepiride nanocrystal was carried out by X-ray powder diffractometry, 
      differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy. In vitro 
      dissolution test, the nanocrystal-loaded capsules of glimepiride showed an 
      evident increase in dissolution rate compared to micronized and market capsules. 
      The in vivo studies demonstrated that a marked enhancement of bioavailability of 
      nanocrystal-loaded capsules was superior compared to the marketed formulation and 
      microcrystal-loaded capsules, which may reduce the risk of side effect by 
      allowing a reduction in either the dose or its frequency of administration.

TI  - Effect of glimepiride on the pharmacokinetics of teneligliptin in healthy Korean 
      subjects.
PG  - 720-725
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.12848 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Teneligliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor used for the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, commonly prescribed in combination with 
      glimepiride. Teneligliptin is metabolized by CYP3A4, and glimepiride might be 
      partly metabolized by CYP3A4. The aim of the study was to investigate the 
      possible effect of glimepiride on the pharmacokinetics of teneligliptin in 
      healthy subjects. METHODS: A repeated dose, open-label, fixed-sequence study was 
      conducted in 26 healthy subjects. All participants were administered 20 mg 
      teneligliptin daily for 6 days. On day 7, 4 mg glimepiride was administered 
      together with 20 mg teneligliptin. Plasma teneligliptin concentrations were 
      measured at a steady state, and its pharmacokinetic characteristics were compared 
      without and with glimepiride. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: No statistically 
      significant difference was found in the effect of glimepiride on teneligliptin 
      pharmacokinetics. The steady-state C(max,ss) values of teneligliptin without and 
      with glimepiride were 207.01 ng/mL and 202.15 ng/mL, respectively. Its AUC(τ) 
      values at steady-state without and with glimepiride were 1527.8 ng · h/mL and 
      1578.6 ng · h/mL, respectively. The point estimation of geometric mean ratios 
      (GMR) and the 90% confidence interval for both C(max,ss) and AUC(τ) were within 
      the equivalence range of 0.8-1.25. The results of the present study revealed that 
      glimepiride did not cause pharmacokinetic interaction with teneligliptin in 
      humans. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Glimepiride did not affect the 
      pharmacokinetic characteristics of teneligliptin in healthy subjects.

TI  - Effect of CYP2C9 genetic polymorphisms on the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of 
      glimepiride in subjects with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 148-54
AB  - Glimepiride, a sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agent, is metabolized by cytochrome P450 
      2C9 (CYP2C9) which is known to have genetic polymorphisms. To examine the effects 
      of CYP2C9 genetic polymorphisms on the safety and efficacy of glimepiride in 
      patients with type 2 diabetes, the responses to the glimepiride were measured in 
      Japanese type 2 diabetic patients with the different CYP2C9 genotype. The 
      reduction in the HbA(1c) was significantly larger (P<0.05) among the CYP2C9*1/*3 
      subjects than among the CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects. The long-term observations of 2 
      patients with a CYP2C9*1/*3 suggested that subjects with a CYP2C9*1/*3 respond 
      well to glimepiride during the initial phase of treatment, but 1 patient have 
      shown the weight gain over the long-term treatment. The pharmacokinetic study 
      showed that the area under the concentration-time curve for glimepiride in the 
      CYP2C9*1/*3 subjects was approximately 2.5-fold higher than that of the 
      CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects. The intrinsic clearance of glimepiride by the CYP2C9*3 
      enzyme was lower than that by the CYP2C9*1 enzyme. These results suggested that 
      the lower hydroxylation activity of glimepiride in the subject with type 2 
      diabetes and CYP2C9*1/*3 led to a marked elevation in the plasma concentrations 
      of glimepiride and a stronger pharmacological effect of glimepiride.

TI  - Development of 3D-Printed, Liquisolid and Directly Compressed Glimepiride 
      Tablets, Loaded with Black Seed Oil Self-Nanoemulsifying Drug Delivery System: In 
      Vitro and In Vivo Characterization.
LID - 10.3390/ph15010068 [doi]
LID - 68
AB  - Glimepiride is characterized by an inconsistent dissolution and absorption 
      profile due to its limited aqueous solubility. The aim of this study was to 
      develop glimepiride tablets using three different manufacturing techniques, as 
      well as to study their quality attributes and pharmacokinetics behavior. Black 
      seed oil based self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) formulation was 
      developed and characterized. Glimepiride liquisolid and directly compressed 
      tablets were prepared and their pre-compression and post-compression 
      characteristics were evaluated. Semi-solid pastes loaded with SNEDDS were 
      prepared and used to develop three-dimensional printing tablets utilizing the 
      extrusion technique. In vivo comparative pharmacokinetics study was conducted on 
      Male Wistar rats using a single dose one-period parallel design. The developed 
      SNEDDS formulation showed a particle size of 45.607 ± 4.404 nm, and a glimepiride 
      solubility of 25.002 ± 0.273 mg/mL. All the studied tablet formulations showed 
      acceptable pre-compression and post-compression characteristics and a difference 
      in their in vitro drug release behavior. The surface of the liquisolid and 
      directly compressed tablets was smooth and non-porous, while the 
      three-dimensional printing tablets showed a few porous surfaces. The inner 
      structure of the liquisolid tablets showed some cracks and voids between the 
      incorporated tablet ingredients while that of the three-dimensional printing 
      tablets displayed some tortuosity and a gel porous-like structure. Most of the 
      computed pharmacokinetic parameters improved with the liquisolid and 
      three-dimensional printed tablets. The relative bioavailabilities of the 
      three-dimensional printed and liquisolid tablets compared to commercial product 
      were 121.68% and 113.86%, respectively. Therefore, the liquisolid and 
      three-dimensional printed tablets are promising techniques for modifying 
      glimepiride release and improving in vivo performance but more clinical 
      investigations are required.

AB  - In this study, we prepared gelatin-coated mesoporous hollow silica nanospheres 
      (GSN) as a drug carrier to improve the water solubility and regulate the release 
      rate of glimepiride (GLM). GLM was loaded into GSN by an absorption method, and 
      drug-loaded samples (GLM-GSN) were characterized by differential scanning 
      calorimeter (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Cellular uptake and in vivo 
      intestinal uptake experiments were performed in rats. In addition, the studies of 
      in-vitro drug dissolution, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic experiments also 
      were performed. GLM-GSN showed excellent drug loading (39.7% ± 0.7%) and 
      sustained GLM release. The state of GLM in GSN was amorphous according to DSC and 
      XRD results. Cellular uptake and in vivo intestinal uptake experiments indicated 
      that GSN could be effectively absorbed, and an MTT experiment demonstrated that 
      GSN had good biocompatibility. Furthermore, the GLM-GSN had a higher 
      bioavailability in pharmacokinetics experiments and a prominent hypoglycemic 
      effect on type-2 diabetes model rats in pharmacodynamic experiments. This study 
      clearly shows that GSN is a promising platform for delivering GLM for the 
      treatment of type-2 diabetes.

      and its possible mechanism.
PG  - 133-8
LID - 10.1159/000377637 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Losartan and glimepiride are commonly used drugs to treat chronic 
      diseases of hypertension and diabetes; they are both substrates of CYP2C9. The 
      aim of the present study was to investigate the possible interaction of losartan 
      and glimepiride both in vitro (rat liver microsomes) and in vivo (healthy 
      Sprague-Dawley rats). METHODS: In rat liver microsomes, 1-10 μmol/l losartan and 
      glimepiride were coincubated, and the inhibitory effect was analyzed. In the 
      subsequent pharmacokinetic study, 15 healthy Sprague-Dawley rats received 
      administrations of 5 mg/kg losartan or 1 mg/kg glimepiride or a coadministration. 
      RESULTS: In the rat liver microsome system, glimepiride showed a slight 
      inhibition of losartan at concentrations of 1-10 μmol/l, whereas losartan 
      exhibited no inhibitory effect on glimepiride. In vivo, glimepiride did not 
      modify the plasma concentration of losartan and its metabolite E-3174. The 
      alteration of an increased AUC and Cmax was observed in the pharmacokinetic 
      parameters of glimepiride and hydroxy glimepiride. CONCLUSIONS: Glimepiride did 
      not affect losartan pharmacokinetics in rats, while losartan potently altered 
      glimepiride metabolism; this result was inconsistent with the in vitro outcome. 
      The mechanism requires further investigation. In clinical settings, attention 
      should be paid to the interaction of these two drugs in the human body as well as 
      the possible adverse reactions of glimepiride.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS: Glimepiride is a commonly used sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agent. 
      There is considerable interindividual variation in the response to sulfonylurea 
      for patients with type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to investigate 
      whether genetic variations influence the efficacy of glimepiride in healthy 
      Korean subjects. METHODS: A single 2-mg oral dose of glimepiride was administered 
      to 46 healthy volunteers. Serial blood sampling for 12h after oral dosing was 
      performed for determination of plasma glimepiride, glucose and insulin levels. We 
      tested the association of seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four 
      candidate genes with the efficacy of glimepiride. RESULTS: Pharmacodynamic 
      profiles for plasma glucose and insulin showed no statistically significant 
      differences among genotype groups, and parameters were not different from one 
      another. There were no association of the KCNJ11, NOS1AP, TCF7L2 and ABCC8 gene 
      polymorphisms and the efficacy of glimepiride. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of these 
      polymorphisms provides no clinical useful information for the pharmacogenetic 
      therapeutic approach for Korean patients with type 2 diabetes.

PG  - 61-9

AB  - Bile acid sequestrants can potentially bind to concomitant drugs. Single-dose 
      studies evaluated the effects of colesevelam on the pharmacokinetics of 
      glimepiride, glipizide extended-release (ER), and olmesartan medoxomil. Each 
      study enrolled healthy subjects aged 18-45 years. The olmesartan medoxomil study 
      used a randomized adaptive crossover design that initially compared olmesartan 
      medoxomil alone versus simultaneously with colesevelam, then olmesartan medoxomil 
      alone versus 4 hours before colesevelam. The other studies used a three-period 
      crossover design (test drug alone, test drug simultaneously with colesevelam, and 
      test drug 4 hours before colesevelam). For the colesevelam coadministration 
      periods, 3,750 mg once daily was dosed throughout the pharmacokinetic sampling 
      period. After each single dose of test drug, serial blood samples were collected 
      for determination of plasma drug concentrations and calculation of 
      pharmacokinetic parameters. Administering colesevelam simultaneously with 
      glimepiride or glipizide ER resulted in minor reductions (18% and 13%, 
      respectively) in total exposure that were negated by staggering colesevelam 
      dosing by 4 hours. Administering colesevelam simultaneously with olmesartan 
      medoxomil resulted in a major reduction (39%) in olmesartan exposure that was 
      reduced by staggering colesevelam dosing by 4 hours. This reduction in olmesartan 
      exposure is not predicted to have a clinically significant impact on blood 
      pressure control.

TI  - Characterization and therapeutic efficacy evaluation of glimepiride and

AB  - The glimepiride/L-arginine (GA) binary systems were prepared at various molar 
      ratios by using a supercritical antisolvent (SAS) process. For comparison, the GA 
      system was also prepared by physical mixing (PM), melt quenching (MQ), and 
      solvent evaporation (SE) methods. Analyses by DSC and PXRD showed that only the 
      GA binary mixture at 1:1 M ratio prepared by the SAS process was a pure 
      co-amorphous mixture with an excellent content uniformity. On the other hand, GA 
      mixture prepared by PM and SE were not pure co-amorphous systems and contained 
      crystalline eutectic mixture, and MQ method at 170 °C induced the decrease in 
      drug content due to decomposition of glimepiride. The positive deviation of 
      experimentally measured glass transition temperature (T(g)) compared to predicted 
      T(g) by the Gordon Taylor equation suggests specific molecular interactions 
      between glimepiride and L-arginine in solid-state GA co-amorphous (GACA) mixture. 
      The intermolecular interactions between glimepiride and L-arginine in GACA system 
      were characterized by FT-IR and solid-state NMR analyses. Improved glimepiride 
      dissolution rate of GACA formulation were confirmed using the solubility test, 
      contact angle measurement, and dissolution test. Furthermore, the evaluation of 
      pharmacodynamic hypoglycemic effect demonstrated that GACA prepared by the SAS 
      process significantly improved the therapeutic efficacy of glimepiride.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of a fixed-dose glimepiride/sustained-release metformin 
      combination.
PG  - 142-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of glimepiride and metformin have been 
      established for the combination drug as well as each agent individually. However, 
      the PK profiles of a combination drug containing glimepiride and 
      sustained-release (SR) metformin have not been reported. To compare the 
      pharmacokinetic profiles of glimepiride/SR metformin (2 mg/500 mg) with the PK of 
      immediate-release (IR) formulations, an open-label, randomized, 3-period, 
      3-sequence, 3-treatment, crossover study was conducted in 12 healthy subjects. 
      METHODS: After a single administration of glimepiride/SR metformin 2 mg/500 mg 
      (Treatment) or glimepiride/metformin IR 2 mg/500 mg (Reference 1), or 
      administration of 2 doses of glimepiride/metformin IR 1 mg/250 mg 12 h apart 
      (Reference 2), serial blood samples were collected and drug concentrations 
      determined by liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry. PK parameters 
      (Cmax and AUC24) for glimepiride and metformin were log-transformed and compared 
      using a mixed-effects model analysis of variance (ANOVA). The mean differences 
      and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were back-transformed to obtain geometric mean 
      ratios along with the CIs for the ratios. RESULTS: Treatment demonstrated similar 
      systemic exposures for glimepiride; the geometric mean ratio (95% CIs) for 
      glimepiride AUC24 was 1.05 (0.97 - 1.13) for Treatment relative to Reference 1 
      and 1.08 (1.00 - 1.17) for Treatment relative to Reference 2. The SR formulation 
      showed a delay in the time to reach maximum concentration for metformin from 1.0 
      - 4.0 h to 4.0 - 8.0 h and a decreased AUC24 value; the geometric mean ratio for 
      metformin AUC24 was 0.87 (0.74 - 1.03) for Treatment relative to Reference 1 and 
      0.75 (0.63 - 0.88) for Treatment relative to Reference 2. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      demonstrates for the first time that fixed-dose glimepiride and SR metformin 2 
      mg/500 mg shows a PK profile similar to that of glimepiride, but with a delayed 
      time to maximum concentration and slightly decreased bioavailability for 
      metformin compared with the IR fixed-dose combination, in healthy volunteers. PK 
      profiles from this exploratory study will be helpful in designing and conducting 
      further studies in diabetic patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This work was aimed to develop a Curcuma oil-based 
      self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) 3D-printed polypills 
      containing glimepiride (GMD) and rosuvastatin (RSV) for treatment of dyslipidemia 
      in patients with diabetes as a model for metabolic syndrome (MS). METHODS: 
      Compartmentalized 3D printed polypills were prepared and studied in 
      streptozotocin/poloxamer induced diabetic/dyslipidemic rats. The pharmacokinetic 
      parameters of GMD and RSV in the prepared polypills were evaluated. Blood glucose 
      level, lipid profile, antioxidant, and biochemical markers activities were 
      investigated. Also, histopathological examination of the liver and pancreas was 
      carried out. The atherosclerotic index, the area of islets of Langerhans, and 
      liver steatosis lesion scores were calculated. RESULTS: The developed 
      SNEDDS-loaded GMD/RSV polypills showed acceptable quality control characteristics 
      with a high relative bioavailability of 217.16% and 224.28% for GMD and RSV, 
      respectively, when compared with the corresponding non-SNEDDS pills. The prepared 
      polypills showed dramatic lowering in blood glucose levels and substantial 
      improvement in lipid profile and hepatic serum biomarkers as well as remarkable 
      decrease in serum antioxidants in response to Poloxamer 407 intoxication. The 
      prepared polypills decreased the risk of atherosclerosis and coronary disease by 
      boosting the level of high-density lipoprotein and lowering both triglyceride and 
      low-density lipoprotein. Microscopic examination showed normal hepatic sinusoids 
      and high protection level with less detectable steatosis in the examined 
      hepatocytes. Normal size pancreatic islets with apparently normal exocrine acini 
      and pancreatic duct were also noticed. CONCLUSION: This formulation strategy 
      clearly shows the potential of the developed polypills in personalized medicine 
      for treatment of patients with MS.

TI  - Metabolic study of ginsenoside Rg3 and glimepiride in type 2 diabetic rats by 
      liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry.

LID - 10.1002/rcm.9083 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Ginsenoside Rg3 and glimepiride have been applied to treat type 2 
      diabetes (T2DM) because of their good hypoglycemic effects. In this study, the 
      effects of ginsenoside Rg3 acting synergistically with glimepiride were 
      investigated in liver microsomes from rats with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: An in 
      vitro incubation system with normal rat liver microsomes (RLM) and type 2 
      diabetic rat liver microsomes (TRLM) was developed. The system also included two 
      experimental groups consisting of RLM and TRLM pretreated with ginsenoside Rg3 
      and glimepiride (named the RLMR and TRLMR groups, respectively). The metabolism 
      in the different groups was analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography 
      coupled with quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-Orbitrap MS). RESULTS: 
      The results showed that the concentration of glimepiride increased in RLM and 
      TRLM after treatment with ginsenoside Rg3. Five metabolites (M1-M5) of 
      glimepiride were found, and they were named 3N-hydroxyglimepiride, 
      hydroxyglimepiride, 1,2-epoxy ether-3-hydroxyglimepiride, 1N-hydroxyglimepiride 
      and 1N,2C,S,O,O-epoxy ether-3-hydroxyglimepiride. The metabolite of ginsenoside 
      Rg3 was ginsenoside Rh2. CONCLUSIONS: An in vitro incubation system with RLM and 
      TRLM was developed. The system revealed pathways that produce glimepiride 
      metabolites. Ginsenoside Rg3 may inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes 
      in vitro. The present study showed that ginsenoside Rg3 and glimepiride may be 
      combined for the treatment of T2DM.

TI  - Clinical review of glimepiride.
PG  - 699-713
AB  - This article reviews the pharmacological and clinical aspects of glimepiride, the 
      latest second-generation sulfonylurea for treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (DM). Glimepiride therapy ameliorates the relative insulin secretory deficit 
      found in most patients with Type 2 DM. It is a direct insulin secretagogue; 
      indirectly, it also increases insulin secretion in response to fuels such as 
      glucose. Its action to augment insulin secretion requires binding to a high 
      affinity sulfonylurea receptor, which results in closure of ATP-sensitive 
      potassium channels in the beta-cells of the pancreas. The question has been 
      raised whether insulin secretagogues by acting on vascular or myocardial 
      potassium channels may prevent ischaemic preconditioning, a physiological 
      adaptation that could affect the outcome of coronary heart disease, but there is 
      evidence against this concern being applicable to glimepiride. Glimepiride's 
      antihyperglycaemic efficacy is equal to other secretagogues. It has 
      pharmacokinetic properties that make it less prone to cause hypoglycaemia in 
      renal dysfunction than some other insulin secretagogues, particularly glyburide 
      (also known as glibenclamide in Europe). Its convenient once daily dosing may 
      enhance compliance for diabetic patients who often also require medications for 
      other co-morbid conditions, such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and cardiac 
      disease. Glimepiride is approved for monotherapy, for combination with metformin 
      and with insulin. Clinically, its reduced risk of hypoglycaemia makes it 
      preferable to some other insulin secretagogues when attempting to achieve 
      recommended glycaemic control (haemoglobin A(1c) (HgbA(1c)) 7%). Using suppertime 
      neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) and regular insulin with morning glimepiride in 
      overweight diabetic patients achieves glycaemic goals more quickly than insulin 
      alone and with lower insulin doses.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the hydroxymetabolite of glimepiride 
      (Amaryl) after intravenous administration.
PG  - 69-85
AB  - Glimepiride is a new sulphonylurea which is eliminated by the formation of a 
      hydroxy-metabolite (hydroxy-gli) and a carboxymetabolite (carboxy-gli). Animal 
      studies have shown hydroxy-gli to exhibit some hypoglycaemic effects while 
      carboxy-gli does not appear to have any pharmacological activity. Pharmacokinetic 
      and pharmacodynamic effects of hydroxy-gli were assessed in humans. 12 healthy 
      male volunteers received an intravenous injection of hydroxy-gli (1.5 mg) or 
      placebo in a single blind, randomised, cross-over study. Samples were collected 
      for up to 24 hours (blood) or 48 hours (urine) following administration of 
      hydroxy-gli or placebo. Hydroxy-gli significantly decreased the minimum serum 
      concentration (Cmin) of glucose by 12% and the average serum glucose 
      concentration over the first four hours of treatment (Cavg0-4) by 9% compared 
      with placebo (P < or = 0.05). In addition, maximum serum C-peptide concentration 
      (Cmax) and Cavg0-4 were both increased by 7% after hydroxy-gli (p < or = 0.05). 
      Serum insulin concentrations (Cmax and Cavg0-4) increased by 4% but the 
      differences from placebo were not statistically significant. No adverse events 
      were reported during the study. In conclusion, the hydroxymetabolite of 
      glimepiride shows pharmacological activity in human subjects.

TI  - Synthesized nano particles of glimepiride via spray freezing into cryogenic 
      liquid: characterization, antidiabetic activity, and bioavailability.
PG  - 364-373
LID - 10.1080/10717544.2021.2018524 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this work was to formulate glimepiride (class II drug) which is 
      characterized by low solubility and high permeability as nanostructured particles 
      using a cryogenic technique with an aid of water-soluble polymer to improve its 
      aqueous solubility and hence its bioavailability. 27 formula of glimepiride nano 
      size particles were prepared by a spray freezing into cryogenic liquid (SCFL) 
      using poly vinyl pyrrolidone K-30 (PVP K-30); that three drug polymer ratio (1:1, 
      1:2, and 1:3), with three different volumes of feeding solution (50, 100, 
      150 mL), at three flow rates (10, 20, and 30 mL/min). The prepared formulations 
      were evaluated for production yield, particle size, zeta potential, drug content, 
      release rate, in vivo hypoglycemic activity, and bioavailability. All prepared 
      formulations showed high production yield and drug content ranged between 
      91.1 ± 3.4% and 94.3 ± 1.8% and 95.1 ± 2.8% and 97.1 ± 2.5%, respectively. The 
      mean particles size was ranged between 280 ± 62 nm and 520 ± 30 nm. The results 
      of in vitro release study revealed significant enhancement in the solubility of 
      prepared formulations compared with the pure drug. It was found that optimal 
      formula showed a significant reduction in blood glucose levels in diabetic rats, 
      and 1.79-fold enhancements in oral bioavailability compared with market tablets. 
      Nanoparticle prepared by SCFL method is an encouraging formula for improving the 
      solubility and the bioavailability of glimepiride.

TI  - No apparent pharmacokinetic interactions were found between henagliflozin: A 
      novel sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor and glimepiride in healthy 
      Chinese male subjects.
PG  - 1225-1231
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.13659 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Henagliflozin is a novel selective sodium-glucose 
      co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor with similar inhibitory effect to 
      ertugliflozin. Glimepiride is widely used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM) with few cardiovascular side effects. In the present study, we aimed at 
      evaluating the pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions between henagliflozin and 
      glimepiride. METHODS: An open-label, single-centre, single-arm, 3-period, 
      3-treatment, self-control study was conducted in twelve healthy Chinese male 
      subjects. During each study period, subjects received a single oral dose of 
      glimepiride 2 mg, multiple oral doses of henagliflozin 10 mg or a combination of 
      the two drugs. Serial blood samples were collected 24 h post-dosing for PK 
      analyses. Finger-tip blood glucose was also tested for safety evaluation. RESULTS 
      AND DISCUSSION: Co-administration of henagliflozin with glimepiride did not 
      affect their plasma PK profiles. For henagliflozin, the 90% confidence intervals 
      for the geometric mean ratio (GMR) for the maximum plasma concentrations at 
      steady-state (C(max ss) ) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve 
      during a dosing interval at steady-state (AUC(τ, ss) ) of combination therapy to 
      henagliflozin alone were 1.00 (0.93-1.08) and 1.00 (0.98-1.02), respectively. For 
      glimepiride, the corresponding values of combination therapy to glimepiride alone 
      were 1.00 (0.88-1.13) for maximum plasma concentrations (C(max) ), 0.91 
      (0.84-0.99) for the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0-24 h 
      (AUC(0-24h) ) and 0.91 (0.83-1.00) for the plasma concentration-time curve from 
      0 h to infinite (AUC(0-inf) ), respectively. All values fell within the 
      equivalence range of 0.8-1.25. All monotherapies and combination therapy led to 
      no serious adverse events and were well tolerated. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: 
      Multiple doses of henagliflozin did not exert a significant change on glimepiride 
      PK profiles and a single dose of glimepiride had little effect on henagliflozin 
      blood concentration. Thus, henagliflozin can be co-administered with glimepiride 
      without dose adjustment of either drug.

AB  - The rapid, sensitive, and selective liquid chromatography-electrospray 
      ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-ESI-MS/MS) for the simultaneous 
      estimation and pharmacokinetic investigation of glimepiride and pioglitazone in 
      human plasma has been developed and fully validated. Glimepiride and 
      pioglitazone, compounds which exert synergistic effects on blood glucose control, 
      were investigated in human plasma using deuterium-labeled analogs as internal 
      standards (IS). Liquid-liquid extraction was carried out on 0.2 mL of human 
      plasma using ethyl acetate, and chromatographic separation was performed on an 
      Agilent Eclipse plus C18 column (4.6 mm × 100 mm, 3.5 μm) using a mobile phase 
      consisting of methanol-water-formic acid (95:5:0.1, v/v/v, plus 5mM ammonium 
      acetate) at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. To quantify glimepiride, pioglitazone and 
      their IS, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions of m/z 491.2→352.2, m/z 
      496.2→357.2, m/z 357.2→134.2 and m/z 361.2→138.2 were performed in positive mode. 
      The total run time was 3.0 min and the elution time was about 2.4 min. The method 
      exhibited good separation of analytes, without interference from endogenous 
      substances. The linear calibration curves were 0.2-250 ng/mL for glimepiride and 
      0.2-1,250 ng/mL for pioglitazone; the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 
      0.2 ng/mL for both analytes. Intra- and inter-day reproducibility was less than 
      10% for glimepiride and less than 5% for pioglitazone, with relative errors 
      ranging from -8.00% to 2.80% at the three concentrations of analytes used for 
      quality control (QC). The matrix effect was negligible and recoveries were 
      similar for each analyte and its IS. Glimepiride and pioglitazone were found to 
      be stable under the assay conditions and the method was successfully applied to 
      the evaluation of pharmacokinetic studies of glimepiride and pioglitazone, 
      following oral doses of 2mg glimepiride tablets and 15 mg pioglitazone tablets to 
      16 healthy volunteers.

TI  - Glimepiride pharmacokinetics in obese versus non-obese diabetic patients.
PG  - 30-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is a global concern, accounting for the vast majority 
      of cases of diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is associated with insulin deficiency and 
      insulin resistance and, increasingly, with patients who are overweight or obese. 
      Glimepiride is a popular choice of oral antidiabetic agent for patients with Type 
      2 diabetes since it increases both insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity and, 
      unlike some other oral agents, is associated with weight neutrality or even 
      weight loss. OBJECTIVE: To assess the pharmacokinetic characteristics of 
      glimepiride and its metabolites in normal-weight and morbidly obese patients with 
      type 2 diabetes to determine whether the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride are 
      altered by obesity. METHODS: Normal-weight (n = 14) and morbidly obese (n = 14) 
      men and women (in a 1:1 ratio) with type 2 diabetes received a single oral dose 
      of glimepiride 8 mg following an overnight fast. Serum concentrations of 
      glimepiride and its metabolites, cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl derivative (MI) and 
      carboxyl derivative (MII), and urinary concentrations of these metabolites were 
      measured. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the 2 patient 
      groups for glimepiride in terms of mean peak concentration (C(max)) (p = 0.0807), 
      time to reach C(max) (t(max)) (p = 0.9916), AUC(0-24) (p = 0.2609), AUC(0- 
      infinity ) (p = 0.1275), or terminal half-life (p = 0.3076). Mean t(max) values 
      and relative total clearances for the 2 groups were also equivalent. Some 
      differences were noted with respect to the pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
      between the groups. In particular, over a 24-hour period, the morbidly obese 
      group excreted statistically significantly greater amounts of MI (p = 0.0430) and 
      MII (p = 0.0051) compared with the normal-weight group. However, none of the 
      differences was considered clinically significant since these metabolites do not 
      have meaningful pharmacologic activity. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results 
      presented here indicate that no intrinsic difference is observed in the oral 
      clearance of glimepiride in obese patients compared with non-obese patients. 
      Given that the dosage is titrated to achieve optimal fasting glucose levels, no 
      special dose consideration is required for the use of glimepiride in the 
      treatment of obese patients with type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Drug-drug interaction of losartan and glimepiride metabolism by recombinant 
      microsome CYP2C9*1, 2C9*3, 2C9*13, and 2C9*16 in vitro.
PG  - 732-8
LID - 10.5414/CP202071 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Co-administration of anti-hypertension and anti-diabetic drugs is 
      common in clinical settings. METHODS: In this study, we characterized the 
      drug-drug interactions of losartan (LOS) and glimepiride (GLP) using recombinant 
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 enzymes (CYP2C9*1, CYP2C9*3, CYP2C9*13, and CYP2C9*16). 
      RESULTS: Metabolism of losartan by recombinant CYP2C9* 1, CYP2C9*3, CYP2C9*13, 
      and CYP2C9* 16 was inhibited by glimepiride competitively with IC50 values of 
      0.669 ± 0.055 µM, 0.424 ± 0.032 µM, 2.557 ± 0.058 µM, and 0.667 ± 0.039 µM, 
      respectively. The inhibitory effect of glimepiride on losartan metabolism by 
      CYP2C9*13 was marginal. The apparent Ki value of glimepiride with CYP2C9*3 
      (0.0416 ± 0.0059 µM) was significantly lower than with CYP2C9*1 (0.1476 ± 0.0219 
      µM) and CYP2C9*16 (0.2671 ± 0.0456 µM). On the other hand, losartan weakly 
      inhibited the hydroxylation of glimepiride by P450 2C9 enzymes competitively. The 
      potencies for inhibition of glimepiride hydroxylation were determined to be 
      CYP2C9*1~CYP2C9*3~CYP2C9*16 > CYP2C9*13 by 4 µM losartan. No significant 
      inhibition was observed when 0.5 µM losartan was used. CONCLUSIONS: Given these 
      results, the potential inhibition of losartan metabolism by CYP2C9*3, CYP2C9*13, 
      and CYP2C9*16 in vivo by glimepiride deserves further investigation. These 
      results may provide valuable information for optimizing the anti-hypertension 
      efficacy of losartan when glimepiride is co-administered to patients.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic interactions between glimepiride and rosuvastatin in healthy 
      Korean subjects: does the SLCO1B1 or CYP2C9 genetic polymorphism affect these 
      drug interactions?
PG  - 503-512
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S129586 [doi]
AB  - To improve cardiovascular outcomes, dyslipidemia in patients with diabetes needs 
      to be treated. Thus, these patients are likely to take glimepiride and 
      rosuvastatin concomitantly. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions between these two drugs in healthy males and to 
      explore the effect of SLCO1B1 and CYP2C9 polymorphisms on their interactions in 
      two randomized, open-label crossover studies. Glimepiride was studied in part 1 
      and rosuvastatin in part 2. Twenty-four participants were randomly assigned to 
      each part. All subjects (n=24) completed part 1, and 22 subjects completed part 
      2. A total of 38 subjects among the participants of the PK interaction studies 
      were enrolled in the genotype study to analyze their SLCO1B1 and CYP2C9 
      polymorphisms retrospectively (n=22 in part 1, n=16 in part 2). Comparison of the 
      PK and safety of each drug alone with those of the drugs in combination showed 
      that both glimepiride and rosuvastatin did not interact with each other and had 
      tolerable safety profiles in all subjects. However, with regard to glimepiride 
      PK, the SLCO1B1 521TC group had a significantly higher maximum plasma 
      concentration (C(max,ss)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve 
      during the dose interval at steady state (AUC(τ,ss)) for glimepiride in 
      combination with rosuvastatin than those for glimepiride alone. However, other 
      significant effects of the SLCO1B1 or CYP2C9 polymorphism on the interaction 
      between the two drugs were not observed. In conclusion, there were no significant 
      PK interactions between the two drugs; however, the exposure to glimepiride could 
      be affected by rosuvastatin in the presence of the SLCO1B1 polymorphism.

TI  - Expanding arsenal against diabetes mellitus through nanoformulations loaded with 
      glimepiride and simvastatin: A comparative study.
PG  - 51976-51988
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-19371-z [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus is one of the most common and life-threatening diseases 
      found across the globe. It occurs due to insulin resistance (IR). Major causes of 
      IR include obesity, sedentary life style and hyperlipidemia. Glimepiride (GLM) is 
      one of the most common oral sulphonyl ureas that is being used to treat diabetes 
      and Simvastatin (SIM) is one of the most common statins that is used to treat 
      hyperlipidaemia. However, both the drugs suffer from dissolution rate limited 
      oral bioavailability. Hence, the aim of present study was to develop two 
      different nanoformulations viz. nanosuspension and self-nanoemulsifying drug 
      delivery systems (SNEDDS) and evaluate their potential in treating type 2 
      diabetes mellitus on streptozotocin (STZ) induced rats. In the present study two 
      such drugs, GLM and SIM were co-formulated into nanosuspension (NS) as well as 
      self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (L-SNEDDS). Both formulations were 
      spray dried for solidification and evaluated for their antidiabetic potential 
      against high fat diet and streptozotocin induced rat model. The study showed 
      significant (p < 0.05) decrease in lipid/cholesterol and blood glucose levels and 
      significant increase in antioxidant levels in the rats treated with NS and SNEDDS 
      containing the drugs alone as well as their combination as compared to their 
      unprocessed forms. However, the efficacy was more prominent in case of 
      combination possibly due to dual benefits i.e., decrease in IR due to statin and 
      control of blood glucose level. Among NS and SNEDDS, NS was found more 
      efficacious than that of the SNEDDS possibly due to higher enhancement of oral 
      bioavailability in case of NS.

TI  - Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modelling to Identify Physiological and 
      Drug Parameters Driving Pharmacokinetics in Obese Individuals.
PG  - 277-295
LID - 10.1007/s40262-022-01194-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obese individuals are often underrepresented in clinical trials, 
      leading to a lack of dosing guidance. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate 
      which physiological parameters and drug properties determine drug disposition 
      changes in obese using our physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) 
      framework, informed with obese population characteristics. METHODS: Simulations 
      were performed for ten drugs with clinical data in obese (i.e., midazolam, 
      triazolam, caffeine, chlorzoxazone, acetaminophen, lorazepam, propranolol, 
      amikacin, tobramycin, and glimepiride). PBPK drug models were developed and 
      verified first against clinical data in non-obese (body mass index (BMI) ≤ 30 
      kg/m(2)) and subsequently in obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) without changing any drug 
      parameters. Additionally, the PBPK model was used to study the effect of obesity 
      on the pharmacokinetic parameters by simulating drug disposition across BMI, 
      starting from 20 up to 60 kg/m(2). RESULTS: Predicted pharmacokinetic parameters 
      were within 1.25-fold (71.5%), 1.5-fold (21.5%) and twofold (7%) of clinical 
      data. On average, clearance increased by 1.6% per BMI unit up to 64% for a BMI of 
      60 kg/m(2), which was explained by the increased hepatic and renal blood flows. 
      Volume of distribution increased for all drugs up to threefold for a BMI of 60 
      kg/m(2); this change was driven by pK(a) for ionized drugs and logP for neutral 
      and unionized drugs. C(max) decreased similarly across all drugs while t(max) 
      remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: Both physiological changes and drug properties 
      impact drug pharmacokinetics in obese subjects. Clearance increases due to 
      enhanced hepatic and renal blood flows. Volume of distribution is higher for all 
      drugs, with differences among drugs depending on their pK(a)/logP.

AB  - PURPOSE: We aimed to enhance the solubility, dissolution rate, oral 
      bioavailability, and α-glucosidase inhibition of glimepiride (Glm) by fabricating 
      its nanosuspension using a precipitation-ultrasonication approach. METHODS: Glm 
      nanosuspensions were fabricated using optimized processing conditions. 
      Characterization of Glm was performed using Malvern Zetasizer, scanning electron 
      microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, 
      and powder X-ray diffraction. Minimum particle size and polydispersity index 
      (PDI) values were found to be 152.4±2.42 nm and 0.23±0.01, respectively, using 
      hydroxypropyl methylcellulose: 6 cPs, 1% w/v, polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 1% w/v, 
      and sodium lauryl sulfate 0.12% w/v, keeping ultrasonication power input at 400 
      W, with 15 minutes' processing at 3-second pauses. In vivo oral bioavailability 
      was assessed using rabbits as a model. RESULTS: The saturation solubility of the 
      Glm nanosuspensions was substantially enhanced 3.14-fold and 5.77-fold compared 
      to unprocessed drug in stabilizer solution and unprocessed active pharmaceutical 
      ingredient. Also, the dissolution rate of the nanosuspensions ws substantially 
      boosted when compared to the marketed formulation and unprocessed drug candidate. 
      The results showed that >85% of Glm nanosuspensions dissolved in the first 10 
      minutes compared to 10.17% of unprocessed Glm), 42.19% of microsuspensions, and 
      19.94% of marketed tablets. In-vivo studies conducted in animals, i.e. rabbits, 
      demonstrated that maximum concentration and AUC(0-24) with oral dosing were 
      twofold (5 mg/kg) and 1.74-fold (2.5 mg/kg) and 1.80-fold (5 mg/kg) and 1.63-fold 
      (2.5 mg/kg), respectively, and compared with the unprocessed drug formulation. 
      In-vitro α-glucosidase inhibition results showed that fabricated nanosuspensions 
      had a pronounced effect compared to unprocessed drug. CONCLUSION: The optimized 
      batch fabricated by ultrasonication-assisted precipitation can be useful in 
      boosting oral bioavailability, which may be accredited to enhanced solubility and 
      dissolution rate of Glm, ultimately resulting in its faster rate of absorption 
      due to nanonization.

      Delivery and Upgrading Its Anti-Diabetic Activity.
LID - 10.3390/gels9060494 [doi]
LID - 494
AB  - Transdermal drug delivery has been widely adopted as a plausible alternative to 
      the oral route of administration, especially for drugs with poor systemic 
      bioavailability. The objective of this study was to design and validate a 
      nanoemulsion (NE) system for transdermal administration of the oral hypoglycemic 
      drug glimepiride (GM). The NEs were prepared using peppermint/bergamot oils as 
      the oil phase and tween 80/transcutol P as the surfactant/co-surfactant mixture 
      (S(mix)). The formulations were characterized using various parameters such as 
      globule size, zeta potential, surface morphology, in vitro drug release, 
      drug-excipient compatibility studies, and thermodynamic stability. The optimized 
      NE formulation was then incorporated into different gel bases and examined for 
      gel strength, pH, viscosity, and spreadability. The selected drug-loaded 
      nanoemulgel formulation was then screened for ex vivo permeation, skin 
      irritation, and in vivo pharmacokinetics. Characterization studies revealed the 
      spherical shape of NE droplets with an average size of ~80 nm and a zeta 
      potential of -11.8 mV, which indicated good electrokinetic stability of NE. In 
      vitro release studies revealed enhanced drug release from the NE formulation 
      compared to the plain drug. GM-loaded nanoemulgel showed a 7-fold increment in 
      drug transdermal flux compared to plain drug gel. In addition, the GM-loaded 
      nanoemulgel formulation did not elicit any signs of inflammation and/or 
      irritation on the applied skin, suggesting its safety. Most importantly, the in 
      vivo pharmacokinetic study emphasized the potential of nanoemulgel formulation to 
      potentiate the systemic bioavailability of GM, as manifested by a 10-fold rise in 
      the relative bioavailability compared to control gel. Collectively, transdermal 
      NE-based GM gel might represent a promising alternative to oral therapy in the 
      management of diabetes.

AB  - We aimed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects of 
      glimepiride in the Spontaneously Diabetic Torii (SDT) rat, which is a non-obese 
      model of type 2 diabetes. After oral administration of glimepiride (10 mg/kg), 
      the maximum plasma concentrations and the area under the curve from 0 to 6 h of 
      glimepiride in SDT rats were significantly higher than those in age-matched 
      Sprague-Dawley rats. Whereas, additional insulin secretion following glimepiride 
      treatment was markedly reduced in SDT rats. Thus, the SDT rat can be regarded as 
      a model that reflects type 2 diabetes with reduced insulin secretory capacity. 
      Our findings suggested that glimepiride could be ineffective in sever type 2 
      diabetic patients.

AB  - Voriconazole, a triazole antifungal, is gaining popularity in the treatment of 
      invasive fungal infections, mostly in the immuno-compromised patients. 
      Voriconazole, a CYP2C9 inhibitor, has many potential drug interactions. Its 
      interactions are both due to its pharmacokinetic properties and the genetic 
      polymorphism of CYP2C9 enzymes. Here is a case report of one such drug-drug 
      interaction between voriconazole and glimepiride, an oral hypoglycemic agent, 
      which led to prolonged and persistent hypoglycemia for 48 h. It was diagnosed by 
      the temporal association of the occurrence of symptoms with voriconazole intake. 
      The patient stabilized on withdrawal of the responsible drugs. Due to the high 
      incidence of co-prescribing voriconazole with other drugs, caution has to be 
      exercised while prescribing it. Clinicians' awareness, a high index of suspicion 
      and constant monitoring for adverse drug reactions, expected or unexpected drug 
      interactions has to be emphasized, even if the co-prescribed drugs are in normal 
      therapeutic doses.

TI  - Evaluation of Bioequivalency and Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Two Formulations 
      of Glimepiride 1-mg in Chinese Subjects.
PG  - 2637-2644
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S249355 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Glimepiride, an FDA-approved oral hypoglycemic drug, is a long-acting 
      sulfonylurea (SU), used for treating type 2 diabetes. The study aimed to evaluate 
      the bioequivalence and safety profiles of two different formulations of 
      glimepiride 1 mg from two different manufactures in healthy Chinese subjects in 
      the fasting and fed state in order to acquire adequate pharmacokinetic evidence 
      for registration approval of the test formulation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This 
      study is an open-label, two-period, two-sequence, randomized, two-way crossover 
      pharmacokinetic study in healthy Chinese subjects in the fasting and fed state. 
      Seventy-two subjects were randomly assigned to the fasting group and the fed 
      group (n=36 each). We collected blood samples, 24-h post drug administration. The 
      plasma concentration of glimepiride was assessed using HPLC coupled with mass 
      spectrometry. The following parameters were evaluated: AUC(0-inf), AUC(0-last), 
      C(max), t(1⁄2), T(max), and λ(z). Safety was determined based on the occurrence 
      of adverse events (AEs) and laboratory examinations (biochemistry, hematology, 
      and urinalysis) throughout the entire study period. RESULTS: The geometric mean 
      ratios (GMR) amongst the two glimepiride formulations for the primary 
      pharmacokinetic parameters, ie, AUC(0-inf), AUC(0-last), and C(max) as well as 
      the corresponding 90% CIs, were all within the range of 80.00-125.00% in the 
      fasting and fed state. The safety profile for both treatments was comparable. 
      CONCLUSION: PK analysis revealed that the test and reference formulations of 
      glimepiride were bioequivalent and well tolerated in healthy Chinese subjects.

TI  - No pharmacokinetic interaction between ipragliflozin and sitagliptin, 
      pioglitazone, or glimepiride in healthy subjects.
PG  - 937-43
LID - 10.1111/j.1463-1326.2012.01624.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effect of ipragliflozin on the pharmacokinetics of 
      sitagliptin, pioglitazone or glimepiride and vice versa in healthy subjects. 
      METHODS: Three trials with an open-label, randomized, two-way crossover design 
      were conducted in healthy subjects. Ipragliflozin 150 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg, 
      pioglitazone 30 mg or glimepiride 1-2 mg were administered alone or in 
      combination. Primary endpoints were the area under the curve from the time of 
      dosing to infinity (AUC(inf)) and the maximum observed plasma concentration 
      (C(max)) of each drug. RESULTS: Multiple doses of ipragliflozin did not change 
      the AUC(inf) and C(max) of a single dose of sitagliptin, pioglitazone or 
      glimepiride. All geometric mean ratios and 90% CIs for AUC(inf) and C(max) , with 
      and without ipragliflozin, were within the predefined range of 80-125% (AUC(inf) 
      : sitagliptin 100.1 [96.9-103.5], pioglitazone 101.7 [96.6-107.0], glimepiride 
      105.1 [101.3-109.0], and C(max) : sitagliptin 92.4 [82.8-103.1], pioglitazone 
      98.6 [87.7-110.8], glimepiride 110.0 [101.9-118.8]). Similarly, multiple doses of 
      sitagliptin, pioglitazone or glimepiride did not change the pharmacokinetics of a 
      single dose of ipragliflozin (AUC(inf) : 95.0 [93.4-103.1], 100.0 [98.1-102.0], 
      99.1 [96.6-101.6]; and C(max) : 96.5 [90.4-103.1], 93.5 [86.3-101.2], 97.3 
      [89.2-106.2]). Ipragliflozin either alone or in combination with any of the three 
      glucose-lowering drugs was well tolerated in healthy subjects. CONCLUSION: 
      Ipragliflozin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin, pioglitazone or 
      glimepiride and vice versa, suggesting that no dose-adjustments are likely to be 
      required when ipragliflozin is given in combination with other glucose-lowering 
      drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Studies.
PG  - 327-333
LID - 10.1093/chromsci/bmw189 [doi]
AB  - A novel, simple and mass spectrometry (MS) compatible high-performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC) method is reported for the simultaneous estimation of 
      ilaprazole (ILA) and glimepiride (GLM) in rat plasma. The bio-analytical 
      procedure involves extraction of ILA, GLM and internal standard (IS) from rat 
      plasma with a solid-phase extraction (SPE) process. The chromatographic analysis 
      was performed on Waters-600 system using an isocratic mobile phase comprising 
      methanol:water (80:20 % v/v) with pH of water modified to three using formic acid 
      at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and Kinetex C18 column maintained at 30 ± 1°C. The 
      signals were monitored using a PDA detector set at 225 nm. IS, ILA and GLM eluted 
      at 2.04, 4.7 and 7.4 min, respectively, and the total run time was 10 min. Method 
      validation was performed as per US Food and Drug Administration guidelines and 
      the results met the acceptance criteria. The calibration curve was linear over a 
      concentration range of 10-600 ng/mL (r2 = 0.999). The intra- and inter-day 
      precisions for ILA and GLM were (%RSD values) in the range of 1.52-9.74 and 
      1.52-11.76%, respectively, in rat plasma. The method was successfully applied in 
      pharmacokinetic studies followed by oral administration of GLM and ILA in rats.

TI  - Effects of different doses glimepiride intake on the pharmacokinetics of 
      benzbromarone in rats.
PG  - 191-197
AB  - Benzbromarone (BNR) is prescribed for the management of hyperuricemia, whereas 
      glimepiride (GLM) for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Both drugs are 
      certified to be mainly metabolized via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 in vivo and may 
      have the potential drug-drug interactions. This study aims to investigate the 
      possible influence of orally administered low- and high-dose glimepiride (GLM) on 
      pharmacokinetic characteristics (PK) of benzbromarone (BNR) in rats. Fifteen rats 
      were randomly assigned to group A, B and C (n=5) and administered 0.5% sodium 
      carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), 0.5mg/kg GLM (low-dose) and 1.0 mg/kg GLM 
      (high-dose) once daily for 8 days, respectively, which were all followed with a 
      single oral dose of BNR (9.0 mg/kg) on the day 8th. Blood samples were obtained 
      from retro orbital plexus at the time points of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 
      and 24h and BNR in plasma was quantitated by HPLC-MS/MS assay. Resultantly a 
      slight influence of GLM on PK of BNR could be found in rats. When compared with 
      Group A, the half-life time (t1/2z) of BNR in Group B and C significantly 
      decreased 52.39% and 73.49%, respectively, although other major PK parameters 
      were negligibly changed by co-administration of GLM. On the whole, the 
      combinational therapy of GLM at low or high dose would notably alter the 
      elimination of BNR and the effect was dose-dependent.

TI  - New formulation approaches to improve solubility and drug release from fixed dose 
      combinations: case examples pioglitazone/glimepiride and ezetimibe/simvastatin.

AB  - Low aqueous solubility is often a limiting aspect to the bioavailability of 
      poorly soluble, but highly permeable drugs (class II compounds according to the 
      Biopharmaceutics Classification System - BCS) administered in single drug 
      products or as fixed dose combinations. The aim of the present series of 
      experiments was to improve the solubility and dissolution of two fixed dose 
      combination formulations (FDC), each consisting of two BCS class II drugs. The 
      first FDC contained a weak acid (glimepiride) and a weak base (pioglitazone), 
      while the second FDC contained two compounds (simvastatin and ezetimibe) that are 
      essentially non-ionised over the physiological pH range. The formulation 
      approaches used were as follows: (a) an inclusion complex with 
      hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD), (b) a solid dispersion with Soluplus, a 
      new highly water soluble polyvinyl caprolactam - polyvinyl acetate - polyethylene 
      glycol graft copolymer and (c) a ternary inclusion complex with both HP-β-CD and 
      Soluplus. Solid state analysis was performed for the pure drugs, and all 
      formulations using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The in vitro performance of 
      the different formulation approaches, as gauged by solubility and dissolution 
      experiments, was compared with that of the marketed products containing the 
      respective fixed dose combinations, Tandemact 30 mg/4 mg tablets and Inegy 10 
      mg/40 mg tablets. The FDCs of the pure drugs and the marketed products showed 
      very poor (and especially for pioglitazone, strongly pH-dependent) dissolution. 
      By contrast, all binary and ternary inclusion complexes showed enhanced release 
      for both drugs in the FDC. The ternary inclusion complex generated synergistic 
      improvement in solubility and dissolution results for both FDCs. For example, in 
      pH conditions of the fasted small intestine after a test duration of 240 min, we 
      observed 100% dissolution of both drugs from the ternary pioglitazone/glimepiride 
      (30 mg/4 mg) complex formulation, whereas from the marketed formulation less than 
      5% pioglitazone, and only 25% glimepiride dissolved. Using the same conditions, 
      60% ezetimibe and 85% simvastatin dissolved from the ternary 
      ezetimibe/simvastatin (10 mg/40 mg) complex formulation, whereas with less than 
      5% ezetimibe and 10% simvastatin dissolved after 240 min, the marketed FDC 
      formulation showed poor dissolution. Based on the results of the present study, 
      the bioavailability of both drugs in the fixed dose combination is likely to be 
      increased after oral administration of the new formulations, especially when the 
      fixed dose combination is formulated as a ternary complex consisting of HP-β-CD 
      and Soluplus.

TI  - Glimepiride. A review of its use in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 563-84
AB  - Glimepiride is a sulphonylurea agent that stimulates insulin release from 
      pancreatic beta-cells and may act via extrapancreatic mechanisms. It is 
      administered once daily to patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes 
      mellitus in whom glycaemia is not controlled by diet and exercise alone, and may 
      be combined with insulin in patients with secondary sulphonylurea failure. The 
      greatest blood glucose lowering effects of glimepiride occur in the first 4 hours 
      after the dose. Glimepiride has fewer and less severe effects on cardiovascular 
      variables than glibenclamide (glyburide). Pharmacokinetics are mainly unaltered 
      in elderly patients or those with renal or liver disease. Few drug interactions 
      with glimepiride have been documented. In patients with type 2 diabetes, 
      glimepiride has an effective dosage range of 0.5 to 8 mg/day, although there is 
      little difference in efficacy between dosages of 4 and 8 mg/day. Glimepiride was 
      similar in efficacy to glibenclamide and glipizide in 1-year studies. However, 
      glimepiride appears to reduce blood glucose more rapidly than glipizide over the 
      first few weeks of treatment. Glimepiride and gliclazide were compared in 
      patients with good glycaemic control at baseline in a 14-week study that noted no 
      differences between their effects. Glimepiride plus insulin was as effective as 
      insulin plus placebo in helping patients with secondary sulphonylurea failure to 
      reach a fasting blood glucose target level of < or = 7.8 mmol/L, although lower 
      insulin dosages and more rapid effects on glycaemia were seen with glimepiride. 
      Although glimepiride monotherapy was generally well tolerated, hypoglycaemia 
      occurred in 10 to 20% of patients treated for < or = 1 year and > or = 50% of 
      patients receiving concomitant insulin for 6 months. Pooled clinical trial data 
      suggest that glimepiride may have a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia than 
      glibenclamide, particularly in the first month of treatment. Dosage is usually 
      started at 1 mg/day, titrated to glycaemic control at 1- to 2-week intervals to a 
      usual dosage range of 1 to 4 mg/day (maximum 6 mg/day in the UK or 8 mg/day in 
      the US). CONCLUSIONS: Glimepiride is a conveniently administered alternative to 
      other sulphonylureas in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus not well 
      controlled by diet alone. Its possible tolerability advantages and use in 
      combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs require further study. Glimepiride 
      is also reported to reduce exogenous insulin requirements in patients with 
      secondary sulphonylurea failure when administered in combination with insulin.

TI  - Differential effects of vildagliptin and glimepiride on glucose fluctuations in 
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus assessed using continuous glucose 
      monitoring.
PG  - 1111-9
LID - 10.1111/dom.12146 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To assess whether there is a difference in the effects of vildagliptin and 
      glimepiride on glucose fluctuation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM) using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). METHODS: This was an 
      open-label, randomized cross-over study conducted in T2DM patients. A total of 24 
      patients (age: 58.3 ± 5.56 years, baseline HbA1c: 7.6 ± 0.50%) who were on stable 
      metformin monotherapy (500-3000 mg) were enrolled, and all completed the study. 
      Each patient received two 5-day treatments (vildagliptin 50 mg b.i.d. or 
      glimepiride 2 mg q.d.) in a cross-over manner. Various biomarkers and blood 
      glucose concentrations were measured following breakfast. The 24-h glucose 
      profiles were also measured using the CGM device at baseline and after 5 days of 
      treatment, and fluctuations in glucose levels were estimated from CGM data. 
      RESULTS: Both vildagliptin and glimepiride reduced postprandial glucose levels, 
      based on both CGM data (15% vs. 16%) and measured plasma glucose (13% vs.17%). 
      Vildagliptin showed lower glucose fluctuations than glimepiride as measured by 
      mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions (MAGE, p = 0.1076), standard deviation 
      (s.d., p = 0.1346) of blood glucose rate of change, but did not reach statistical 
      significance attributed to the small sample size. MAGE was reduced by ∼20% with 
      vildagliptin versus glimepiride. Vildagliptin led to statistically significant 
      lowering of the rate of change in the median curve (RCMC) and interquartile range 
      (IQR) of glucose. Treatment with vildagliptin significantly increased the levels 
      of active glucagon-like peptide-1 by 2.36-fold (p ≤ 0.0001) and suppressed 
      glucagon by 8% (p = 0.01), whereas glimepiride significantly increased the levels 
      of insulin and C-peptide by 21% (p = 0.012) and 12% (p = 0.003), respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Vildagliptin treatment was associated with less fluctuation of 
      glucose levels than glimepiride treatment as assessed by 24-h CGM device, 
      suggesting vildagliptin may have the potential to offer long-term beneficial 
      effects for patients with T2DM in preventing the development of complications of 
      diabetes.

AB  - The present study aimed to develop buccoadhesive film of glimepiride with unique 
      combination of polymers and to investigate its effect(s) on physicomechanical 
      parameters, drug-release, and permeation of films. Drug-polymer interaction was 
      examined by FTIR and DSC analysis. Films were prepared by solvent casting 
      technique and characterized for film strength (320 ± 8.5 g, 28.98 ± 2.00 mJ), 
      buccoadhesive strength (28.8 ± 1.37 g, 3.04 ± 0.32 mJ), and tensile strength 
      (260 ± 6.88 g, 18.00 ± 0.44 mJ) by new instrumental techniques. Increase in 
      polymer concentration augmented zeta potential of polymeric matrix-mucin mixture 
      and exhibited strong buccoadhesion (electrical theory). Buccoadhesion was also 
      influenced by particle size (adsorption theory) and swelling (wetting theory). 
      Erosion behavior of films was observed in swelling and SEM studies. Film GM4 
      exhibited 98 ± 2% in vitro drug release and 85 ± 8% ex vivo drug permeation in 
      12 h with controlled diffusion mechanism. Films were compatible with oral 
      probiotic microorganisms. Stability studies revealed no significant (P < 0.05) 
      variation in physicomechanical characteristics.

TI  - Effect of Piperazine Dithioctate on the Oral Pharmacokinetics of Glimepiride in 
      Rats.
PG  - 1161-8
LID - 10.1248/bpb.b15-00044 [doi]
AB  - The objective of the present work was to investigate the potential for 
      pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between glimepiride (GMP) and piperazine 
      dithioctate (PDT) in rats to support the development of an orally combined 
      product of the two drugs. An LC-MS/MS bioanalytical method was developed for 
      simultaneous quantification of GMP and thioctic acid (TA) in rat plasma. The 
      accuracy, precision, linearity, selectivity, and recovery were all within an 
      acceptable range. The oral plasma exposure of the GMP solution was more than 
      14-times greater than that of the GMP suspension at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, 
      suggesting a dissolution-limited absorption of the GMP suspension. Oral 
      co-administration of PDT (72 mg/kg) with GMP suspension (0.5 mg/kg) reduced the 
      plasma GMP exposure by approximately 80% without a significant change in t1/2 and 
      tmax. Oral co-administration of PDT with GMP solution had no significant effect 
      on the plasma pharmacokinetics of GMP. PDT lowered the pH (from ca. 7 to 5.6) and 
      the dissolved GMP concentration in the GMP suspension. It was also shown that GMP 
      was more soluble at pH 7 than at 5.7 in an aqueous solution, and the oral plasma 
      exposure of a GMP suspension at pH 7.0 was substantially higher than that of a 
      suspension at pH 5.7. These results suggest that the pH-dependent solubility of 
      GMP was likely responsible for PDT's effect on the oral absorption of GMP. In 
      conclusion, the current work suggests a possibility of drug-drug interaction 
      between GMP and PDT upon oral co-administration.

TI  - Strategies to improve dissolution and oral absorption of glimepiride tablets: 
      solid dispersion versus micronization techniques.
PG  - 727-36
LID - 10.3109/03639045.2010.538061 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study is to compare two different dissolution-enhancing 
      strategies, solid dispersion (SD) and micronized techniques, for improving oral 
      absorption of poorly soluble glimepiride, and to decide which strategy is 
      suitable for its solubilization. The formulation of glimepiride SD was prepared 
      by a solvent-evaporation process with povidone k-30 (PVPk30) at a weight ratio of 
      1:9 (drug:carrier). The other was prepared via a modified micronization 
      technique, where glimepiride was premilled together with lactose and Lutrol F68 
      until the milled material passes through a 500 mesh ASTM sieve (30 μm). The 
      dissolution results indicated that the two techniques were both capable of 
      enhancing the dissolution rate and extent of glimepiride. The release profiles of 
      the two prepared products were similar to the marketed product (Amaryl®) in 
      various types of dissolution media. Furthermore, the oral bioavailability was 
      evaluated for the three formulations in fasted beagle dogs. Statistical analysis 
      indicated that there were no significant differences in pharmacokinetic 
      parameters among the two prepared formulations and a marketed product, especially 
      for AUC₀₋₃₆, C(max), and T(max). The dissolution parameters (D₁₀ and AUC₀₋₂₀) in 
      Tris buffer demonstrated the good in vitro/in vivo relationship with T(max) 
      values for the three formulations. In conclusion, our studies confirmed that both 
      SD and micronization techniques were capable of improving dissolution and oral 
      absorption of glimepiride tablets to a similar extent as the marketed product, 
      and the three glimepiride tablets were bioequivalent in the case of the rate and 
      extent of absorption in dogs.

TI  - Glimepiride: role of a new sulfonylurea in the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus.
PG  - 1044-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical pharmacology data regarding the sulfonylurea 
      glimepiride, and to summarize the clinical trials of glimepiride efficacy and 
      safety alone and in combination with insulin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE database search (English language, January 
      1985-April 1997) was performed to identify relevant published articles, including 
      reviews and abstracts; the manufacturer (Hoechst Marion Roussel, Kansas City, MO) 
      provided unpublished data. STUDY SELECTION: Pharmacology information was taken 
      from representative original research articles. Eight clinical studies were 
      selected for analysis on the basis of large enrollment, appropriate study design, 
      and publication of results. DATA EXTRACTION: All clinical trials, published and 
      unpublished, were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea that is 
      pharmacologically distinct from other sulfonylureas because of differences in 
      receptor-binding properties and potentially selective effects on ATP-sensitive K+ 
      channels. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of glimepiride makes it 
      suitable for once-daily dosing. The safety and efficacy of glimepiride have been 
      confirmed in studies involving more than 5000 patients with type 2 diabetes. In 
      one study, once-daily doses of 1-8 mg reduced fasting plasma glucose from 
      baseline by 43-74 mg/dL more than did placebo (p < 0.001), and hemoglobin (Hb) 
      A1C values decreased by 1.2-1.9% more than with placebo (p < 0.001). Two-thirds 
      of patients achieved tight control (i.e., HbA1C < or = 7.2%). Glimepiride was as 
      effective as second-generation sulfonylureas. The most common adverse events were 
      dizziness and headache, but no single adverse event occurred in more than 2% of 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: Glimepiride appears to be a useful option for patients 
      with type 2 diabetes not controlled by diet and exercise and who want to achieve 
      tight glucose control. Glimepiride can be used alone, in combination with other 
      antihyperglycemic agents, or in patients with secondary sulfonylurea failure, as 
      an adjunct to insulin therapy.

TI  - Simultaneous Determination of Bosentan, Glimepiride, HYBOS and M1 in Rat Plasma 
      by UPLC-MS-MS and its Application to Pharmacokinetic Study.
PG  - 1159-65
LID - 10.1093/chromsci/bmw003 [doi]
AB  - A rapid and sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry (UPLC-MS-MS) method for the simultaneous determination of bosentan 
      (BOS), glimepiride (GLP), hydroxyl bosentan (HYBOS) and hydroxyl glimepiride (M1) 
      in rat plasma using one-step protein precipitation was developed and validated. 
      After addition of ambrisentan as an internal standard (IS), protein precipitation 
      by acetonitrile was used in sample preparation. Chromatographic separation was 
      achieved on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7 μm 
      particle size, Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) and inline 0.2 μm stainless steel 
      frit filter (Waters Corp.) with acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase 
      at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min with gradient elution. The column temperature was 
      maintained at 40°C. Only 4 min was needed for an analytical run. The retention 
      times were ∼3.29 min for BOS, 3.56 min for GLP, 1.42 min for HYBOS, 1.53 min for 
      M1 and 3.22 min for IS. Electrospray ionization source was employed and operated 
      in positive-ion mode; multiple reaction monitoring mode was applied to target 
      fragment ions m/z 552 → 202, m/z 568 → 202, m/z 491 → 352, m/z 507 → 352 and m/z 
      379 → 347 for BOS, HYBOS, GLP, M1 and IS, respectively. The assay was validated 
      over concentration ranges of 25-5,000 ng/mL (r(2) = 0.9984) for BOS, 1-200 ng/mL 
      (r(2) = 0.9999) for GLP, 0.5-100 ng/mL (r(2) = 0.9999) for HYBOS and 0.1-20 ng/mL 
      (r(2) = 0.9984) for M1. Intra- and interday precision values for replicate 
      quality control samples were within 14.2% for all analytes during the assay 
      validation. Mean quality control accuracy values were within -3.3 to 14.4% of 
      nominal values for all analytes. The mean recoveries of BOS, GLP, HYBOS, M1 and 
      ambrisentan from the plasma exceeded 90.4%. The analytes were stable in rat 
      plasma for at least 2 h at room temperature, 30 days at -40°C and following at 
      least three freeze-thaw cycles (-40°C to room temperature). This method was 
      successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of coadministeration of BOS and 
      GLP in rats.

TI  - Impact of various solid carriers and spray drying on pre/post compression 
      properties of solid SNEDDS loaded with glimepiride: in vitro-ex vivo evaluation 
      and cytotoxicity assessment.
PG  - 1056-1069
LID - 10.1080/03639045.2018.1431656 [doi]
AB  - Development of self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS) of glimepiride 
      is reported with the aim to achieve its oral delivery. Lauroglycol FCC, Tween-80, 
      and ethanol were used as oil, surfactant, and co-surfactant, respectively as 
      independent variables. The optimized composition of SNEDDS formulation (F1) was 
      10% v/v Lauroglycol FCC, 45% v/v Tween 80, 45% v/v ethanol, and 0.005% w/v 
      glimepiride. Further, the optimized liquid SNEDDS were solidified through spray 
      drying using various hydrophilic and hydrophobic carriers. Among the various 
      carriers, Aerosil 200 was found to provide desirable flow, compression, 
      dissolution, and diffusion. Both, liquid and solid-SNEDDS have shown release of 
      more than 90% within 10 min. Results of permeation studies performed on Caco-2 
      cell showed that optimized SNEDDS exhibited 1.54 times higher drug permeation 
      amount and 0.57 times lower drug excretion amount than that of market tablets at 
      4 hours (p < .01). Further, the cytotoxicity study performed on Caco-2 cell 
      revealed that the cell viability was lower in SNEDDS (92.22% ± 4.18%) compared 
      with the market tablets (95.54% ± 3.22%; p > .05, i.e. 0.74). The formulation was 
      found stable with temperature variation and freeze thaw cycles in terms of 
      droplet size, zeta potential, drug precipitation and phase separation. 
      Crystalline glimepiride was observed in amorphous state in solid SNEDDS when 
      characterized through DSC, PXRD, and FT-IR studies. The study revealed successful 
      formulation of SNEDDS for glimepiride.

TI  - Does glimepiride alter the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil citrate in diabetic 
      nephropathy animals: investigating mechanism of interaction by molecular modeling 
      studies.
PG  - 276
LID - 10.1007/s00894-015-2823-x [doi]
AB  - The present study evaluates possible drug interactions between glimepiride (GLIM) 
      and sildenafil citrate (SIL) in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic 
      nephropathic (DN) animals and also postulates the possible mechanism of 
      interaction based on molecular modeling studies. Diabetic nephropathy was induced 
      by single dose of STZ (60 mg kg(-1), i.p.) and was confirmed by assessing blood 
      and urine biochemical parameters 28 days after induction. Selected DN animals 
      were used to explore the drug interaction between GLIM (0.5 mg kg(-1), p.o.) and 
      SIL (2.5 mg kg(-1), p.o.) on the 29th and 70th day of the protocol. Possible drug 
      interaction was assessed by evaluating the plasma drug concentration using 
      HPLC-UV and changes in biochemical parameters in blood and urine were also 
      determined. The mechanism of the interaction was postulated from the results of a 
      molecular modeling study using the Maestro module of Schrodinger software. DN was 
      confirmed as there was significant alteration in blood and urine biochemical 
      parameters in STZ-treated groups. The concentration of SIL increased 
      significantly (P < 0.001) in rat plasma when co-administered with GLIM on the 
      70th day of the protocol. Molecular modeling revealed important interactions with 
      rat serum albumin and CYP2C9. GLIM has a strong hydrophobic interaction with 
      binding site residues of rat serum albumin compared to SIL, whereas for CYP2C9, 
      GLIM forms a stronger hydrogen bond than SIL with polar contacts and hydrophobic 
      interactions. The present study concludes that bioavailability of SIL increases 
      when co-administered chronically with GLIM in the management of DN animals, and 
      the mechanism is supported by molecular modeling studies.

TI  - Rapid and specific approach for direct measurement of glimepiride in human plasma 
      by LC-ESI-MS-MS employing automated 96 well format: application to a 
      bioequivalence study.
PG  - 64-70
LID - 10.1093/chromsci/bmr005 [doi]
AB  - A rapid liquid chromatographic method with electrospray ionization tandem mass 
      spectrometric (LC-MS-MS) detection is developed and validated for quantification 
      of glimepiride in heparinized human plasma. Plasma samples, without a drying and 
      reconstitution step, are extracted by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and eluted 
      with 0.9 mL of acetonitrile-methanol (1:1, v/v) containing 0.05% formic acid. The 
      analyte and glimepiride d8 (internal standard, IS) are chromatographed on a C(18) 
      column; the mobile phase is acetonitrile-2 mm ammonium formate (88:12, v/v), with 
      the pH adjusted to 3.5 with formic acid, at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The 
      retention times of glimepiride and the IS are 0.93 min, and the runtime is 1.6 
      min per sample. Selected reaction monitoring of MH(+) at m/z 491.20 and 499.26 
      result in stable fragment ions with m/z 351.80 and 359.96 for glimepiride and the 
      IS, respectively. The response was a linear function of the concentration in the 
      range of 2.0-650.0 ng/mL, with r ≥ 0.9994. The recovery of glimepiride and the IS 
      ranged from 81.91 to 83.36%. The assay has excellent characteristics and has been 
      successfully used for the analysis of glimepiride in healthy human subjects in a 
      bioequivalence study. It was well suited to clinical studies of the drug 
      involving large numbers of samples.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic comparison of a new glimepiride 1-mg + metformin 500-mg 
      combination tablet formulation and a glimepiride 2-mg + metformin 500-mg 
      combination tablet formulation: a single-dose, randomized, open-label, 
      two-period, two-way crossover study in healthy, fasting Korean male volunteers.
PG  - 2755-64

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coadministration of glimepiride and metformin has been used to 
      achieve glucose control. Because compliance with a multiple medication regimen 
      can be difficult for some patients, combination tablets of glimepiride + 
      metformin might be a suitable alternative for these patients. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study was conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics of test and reference 
      formulations of glimepiride + metformin fixed-dose combination tablets under 
      fasting conditions to meet the regulatory requirements for marketing approval of 
      a new drug in Korea. METHODS: This was a single-dose, randomized, open-label, 
      2-period, 2-way crossover study conducted between March 2007 and May 2007. 
      Healthy fasting Korean men were randomized to 1 of 2 dosing sequences: a single 
      oral administration of a fixed-dose glimepiride 1-mg + metformin 500-mg 
      combination tablet (test) followed by single oral administration of a fixed-dose 
      glimepiride 2 mg + metformin 500 mg combination tablet (reference), separated by 
      a 1-week washout period between doses; or a single oral administration of a 
      fixed-dose glimepiride 2-mg + metformin 500-mg combination tablet followed by 
      single oral administration of a fixed-dose glimepiride 1 mg + metformin 500-mg 
      combination tablet, separated by a 1-week washout period between doses. Serial 
      samples of blood were collected up to 24 hours after oral administration, and 
      drug concentrations in plasma were determined by HPLC-MS/MS. Tolerability was 
      assessed based on adverse events and changes in clinical parameters. Serious 
      adverse events included those that resulted in death, a life-threatening 
      condition, congenital anomaly or birth defect, or required hospitalization or 
      prolongation of existing hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 30 healthy male 
      subjects (mean age, 25.6 years [range, 20-36 years]; weight, 69.5 kg [range, 
      58.2-90.7 kg]) participated in the study. After administration of the test and 
      reference formulations, glimepiride was rapidly absorbed, reaching C(max) with a 
      median T(max) of 1.75 and 2.0 hours, respectively, and then declined 
      exponentially with an average t(1/2) of 8.2 and 8.5 hours. The individual C(max) 
      and AUC(last) of glimepiride were observed to be proportionally increased 
      according to the administered glimepiride dose. The mean (SD) dose-normalized 
      Cmax values of glimepiride 1 and 2 mg were 168.2 (54.9) and 149.9 (47.4) 
      ng/mL/mg, respectively; the mean dose-normalized AUC(last) values of glimepiride 
      1 and 2 mg were 681.5 (190.3) and 635.8 (194.1) ng x h/mL/mg. Individual plots of 
      dose-normalized C(max) and AUC(last) values identified a similarity between the 2 
      groups but no significant between-group differences. A total of 25 adverse events 
      (12 after the test dose and 13 after the reference dose) were reported by 13 of 
      the 30 subjects. All adverse events were considered mild. Twenty-one adverse 
      events were considered related to the study drug (8 after the test dose and 13 
      after the reference dose). Adverse events believed to be related to the test 
      formulation were diarrhea (4 cases), dizziness (1), headache (1), tingling 
      sensation (1), and weakness (1). Adverse events believed to be related to the 
      reference formulation were diarrhea (6 cases), headache (3), cold sweats (1), 
      dyspepsia (1), epigastric discomfort (1), and lethargy (1). There were no 
      clinically significant findings in the laboratory test results or vital sign 
      monitoring during the study. There were no serious adverse events reported. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The C(max) and AUC(last) of glimepiride increased proportionally 
      according to the administered glimepiride dose in this study of healthy, fasting 
      Korean men. The safety profiles of the 2 combination tablets were comparable.

AB  - A new sorbent was synthesized for restricted-access matrix solid phase extraction 
      (RAM-SPE) of the diabetes drugs metformin (MET) and glimepiride (Glim). 
      Mesoporous silica layers were placed on Fe(3)O(4)-magnetized graphene modified 
      with sulfo-functionalized pore walls (denoted as magG@mSiO(2)-SO(3)H composites). 
      The composites have a large specific surface (173 m(2)·g(-1)), appropriate pore 
      sizes (typically 3.7 nm), and sulfo-functionalized pore walls. Magnetic 
      separation can be accomplished within 10 s. The unique properties of the 
      composites allow both MET and Glim to be selectively and quickly extracted from 
      plasma sample. Following magnetic separation and elution by 50% aqueous 
      acetonitrile with 4% ammonium solution, the two drugs were quantified by LC-MS/MS 
      analysis. The assay has high selectivity, good linearity (2.5-4000 ng•mL(-1) for 
      MET and 0.02-1600 ng•mL(-1) for Glim), a low detection limit (as low as 
      60 pg•mL(-1) for MET and 1 pg•mL(-1) for Glim), excellent recovery (above 92.2%), 
      and good precision (RSDs <12%). The method was successfully applied in a 
      pharmacokinetic study in beagle dogs. Graphical abstract Schematic representation 
      of the synthesis of sulfo-functionalized magnetic graphene/mesoporous silica 
      composites, giving a material of type magG@mSiO(2)-SO(3)H. Results showed its 
      great potential as a feasible and alternative adsorbent for the selective 
      extraction of MET and Glim from complicated biological samples.

AB  - A sensitive and rapid ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
      spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed to determine bosentan (BOS) and 
      glimepiride (GPD) in human plasma simultaneously. Chromatographic separation was 
      carried out on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column and mass spectrometric analysis was 
      performed using a QTrap5500 mass spectrometer coupled with an electro-spray 
      ionization (ESI) source in the positive ion mode. The MRM transitions of m/z 
      552.0→202.1 and m/z 491.2→125.9 were used to quantify BOS and GPD, respectively. 
      This assay method has been fully validated in terms of selectivity, linearity, 
      recovery and matrix effect, accuracy, precision and stability. The linearity of 
      this method was found to be within the concentration range of 5-1000 ng/mL for 
      BOS, and 2.5-500 ng/mL for GPD in human plasma. Only 1.5 min was needed for an 
      analytical run. This assay was used to support a clinical study where multiple 
      oral doses were administered to healthy Chinese subjects to investigate the 
      pharmacokinetics of BOS and GPD.

TI  - Formulation design and development of matrix diffusion controlled transdermal 
      drug delivery of glimepiride.
PG  - 349-364
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S147082 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present work was conducted to prepare and evaluate transdermal 
      patches with optimization of suitable polymeric blend of poly(meth) acrylates 
      (Eudragit(®)) (Ammonio Methacrylate Copolymer Ph Eur) for sustained transdermal 
      delivery of glimepiride. METHOD: Polymeric matrix transdermal films were prepared 
      by using Ammonio Methacrylate Copolymer Ph Eur RL 100 and Ammonio Methacrylate 
      Copolymer Ph Eur RS 100 as the film former, and dibutyl phthalate (30% w/w) as 
      the plasticizer. Patches were characterized by physical appearance, thickness, 
      weight variation, folding endurance, percentage erosion, swelling index, moisture 
      content, and moisture uptake capacity. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic 
      studies and differential scanning calorimetry analysis of physical mixtures of 
      contents were performed to identify any chemical and physical interaction between 
      drug and excipients. Five different enhancers (isopropyl myristate [IPM], Span(®) 
      80, Tween(®) 20, eucalyptus oil, and limonene) were employed at three different 
      concentrations of polymer (2%, 5%, and 10% w/w) in order to enhance permeation 
      through rabbit skin. In vitro drug release studies were performed at pH 7.4, and 
      scanning electron microscopy was conducted to elucidate surface morphology before 
      and after the drug release. In vitro permeation studies through rabbit skin were 
      performed on Franz diffusion cells and permeation kinetics followed the Higuchi 
      model. RESULTS: Results of in vitro permeation studies revealed that these 
      enhancers not only increased drug release but also augmented the skin permeation 
      of glimepiride. CONCLUSION: IPM was the most effective enhancer with the highest 
      permeation flux of 51.763 μg/cm(2)/hr, and the enhancement effect of different 
      enhancers on glimepiride permeation through rabbit skin was in the rank order of 
      IPM > eucalyptus oil > Span(®) 80 > Tween(®) 20> limonene.

TI  - Evaluation of pharmacokinetic drug interactions between gemigliptin 
      (dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitor) and glimepiride (sulfonylurea) in healthy 
      volunteers.
PG  - 165-76
LID - 10.1007/s40268-014-0054-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Gemigliptin is approved for the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus. 
      Sulfonylureas are commonly used in combination with other antidiabetic drugs to 
      improve glycemic control. The objective of this study was to evaluate the 
      pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of gemigliptin and glimepiride 
      combination therapy compared with those of monotherapies. METHODS: A randomized, 
      open-label, crossover study was performed on healthy Korean male volunteers. Each 
      subject received the following treatments (A and B) with a 7-day washout period: 
      treatment A consisted of gemigliptin 50 mg once daily administered orally for 6 
      days, followed by concomitant oral dosing of glimepiride 4 mg and gemigliptin 50 
      mg on day 7; treatment B consisted of a single dose of glimepiride 4 mg. Blood 
      samples were collected up to 24-h postdose on day 6 (gemigliptin) and day 7 
      (gemigliptin and glimepiride) following treatment A, and on day 1 (glimepiride) 
      following treatment B. Concentrations of gemigliptin, glimepiride, and 
      metabolites were determined using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Safety assessments were performed throughout the study. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-three subjects completed the study. The geometric mean ratios 
      (GMRs) of C max,ss and AUC τ,ss for gemigliptin were 1.0097 [90 % confidence 
      interval (CI) 0.924-1.103] and 0.9997 (90 % CI 0.976-1.024), respectively. For 
      glimepiride, the GMRs of C max and AUClast were 1.031 (90 % CI 0.908-1.172) and 
      0.995 (90 % CI 0.902-1.097), respectively. Both combination and monotherapy were 
      well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: 
      Gemigliptin and glimepiride did not alter the pharmacokinetic properties of each 
      other when they were co-administered in healthy volunteers, and were generally 
      tolerated.

TI  - Effect of genetic polymorphisms in cytochrome p450 (CYP) 2C9 and CYP2C8 on the 
      pharmacokinetics of oral antidiabetic drugs: clinical relevance.
PG  - 1209-25
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus affects up to 8% of the adult population in Western 
      countries. Treatment of this disease with oral antidiabetic drugs is 
      characterised by considerable interindividual variability in pharmacokinetics, 
      clinical efficacy and adverse effects. Genetic factors are known to contribute to 
      individual differences in bioavailability, drug transport, metabolism and drug 
      action. Only scarce data exist on the clinical implications of this genetic 
      variability on adverse drug effects or clinical outcomes in patients taking oral 
      antidiabetics. The polymorphic enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 is the main 
      enzyme catalysing the biotransformation of sulphonylureas. Total oral clearance 
      of all studied sulphonylureas (tolbutamide, glibenclamide [glyburide], 
      glimepiride, glipizide) was only about 20% in persons with the CYP2C9*3/*3 
      genotype compared with carriers of the wild-type genotype CYP2C9*1/*1, and 
      clearance in the heterozygous carriers was between 50% and 80% of that of the 
      wild-type genotypes. For reasons not completely known, the resulting differences 
      in drug effects were much less pronounced. Nevertheless, CYP2C9 genotype-based 
      dose adjustments may reduce the incidence of adverse effects. The magnitude of 
      how doses might be adjusted can be derived from pharmacokinetic studies. The 
      meglitinide-class drug nateglinide is metabolised by CYP2C9. According to the 
      pharmacokinetic data, moderate dose adjustments based on CYP2C9 genotypes may 
      help in reducing interindividual variability in the antihyperglycaemic effects of 
      nateglinide. Repaglinide is metabolised by CYP2C8 and, according to clinical 
      studies, CYP2C8*3 carriers had higher clearance than carriers of the wild-type 
      genotypes; however, this was not consistent with in vitro data and therefore 
      further studies are needed. CYP2C8*3 is closely linked with CYP2C9*2. CYP2C8 and 
      CYP3A4 are the main enzymes catalysing biotransformation of the 
      thiazolidinediones troglitazone and pioglitazone, whereas rosiglitazone is 
      metabolised by CYP2C9 and CYP2C8. The biguanide metformin is not significantly 
      metabolised but polymorphisms in the organic cation transporter (OCT) 1 and OCT2 
      may determine its pharmacokinetic variability. In conclusion, pharmacogenetic 
      variability plays an important role in the pharmacokinetics of oral antidiabetic 
      drugs; however, to date, the impact of this variability on clinical outcomes in 
      patients is mostly unknown and prospective studies on the medical benefit of CYP 
      genotyping are required.

TI  - Albiglutide: a new GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 1494-501
LID - 10.1177/1060028014545807 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of 
      albiglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in type 2 
      diabetes (T2D). DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search (1950-June 2014) was conducted 
      using the keyword albiglutide. References were reviewed to identify additional 
      sources. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles evaluating 
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, or efficacy of albiglutide were 
      included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Albiglutide is a long-acting GLP-1 RA that lowers 
      glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) and reduces weight by stimulating glucose-dependent 
      insulin secretion, suppressing glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying, and 
      promoting satiety. Albiglutide has a long half-life as a result of resistance to 
      degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and fusion to albumin, thus allowing 
      once-weekly dosing. Albiglutide has been studied as monotherapy and add-on 
      therapy to metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, insulin glargine, and 
      varying combinations of these agents. Clinical studies have shown albiglutide to 
      be superior to placebo, sitagliptin, and glimepiride and noninferior to insulin 
      glargine and insulin lispro at reducing A1C in T2D patients, with A1C changes 
      from baseline ranging from -0.55% to -0.9%. Noninferiority was not achieved when 
      compared to liraglutide and pioglitazone. Weight changes ranged from +0.28 to 
      -1.21 kg. The most common side effects are upper-respiratory-tract infections, 
      diarrhea, nausea, and injection-site reactions. CONCLUSION: Albiglutide is the 
      fourth GLP-1 RA approved in the United States. Advantages include once-weekly 
      dosing and fewer gastrointestinal side effects compared with liraglutide, but it 
      is less effective at reducing A1C and weight compared to liraglutide. It has not 
      been compared head to head with other GLP-1 RAs.

TI  - Teneligliptin: a review in type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 765-72
LID - 10.1007/s40261-015-0348-9 [doi]
AB  - Oral teneligliptin [Teneglucon® (Argentina)], a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, 
      is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). This 
      article reviews the pharmacology, therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of 
      teneligliptin in the treatment of adults with T2DM. In 12- or 16-week, 
      placebo-controlled phase 2 and 3 trials, oral teneligliptin 20 or 40 mg once 
      daily, as monotherapy or in combination with metformin, glimepiride or 
      pioglitazone improved glycaemic control, including in patients with end-stage 
      renal disease, and was generally well tolerated. Most treatment-emergent adverse 
      events were of mild intensity and relatively few patients discontinued treatment 
      because of these events. Improvements in glycaemic control observed in short-term 
      trials were maintained at 52 weeks in extension phases of these trials and in 
      52-week interventional studies, with no new safety concerns identified during 
      this period. In the absence of direct head-to-head clinical trials, the position 
      of teneligliptin relative to other antidiabetic agents in the management of T2DM 
      remains to be determined. In the meantime, teneligliptin is a useful treatment 
      option for adults with T2DM who have not responded adequately to diet and 
      exercise regimens, or the addition of antidiabetic drugs.

TI  - Review of the therapeutic uses of liraglutide.
PG  - 793-811
LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2011.06.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) is a neuroendocrine hormone that 
      increases blood glucose and is a drug target for treatment of type 2 diabetes. 
      Liraglutide, a subcutaneous, once-daily GLP-1 agonist, is approved for the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes in the United States and Europe. It also has been 
      studied for weight loss. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to review all 
      of the relevant literature on the chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, 
      metabolism, clinical trials, safety, drug interactions, cost, and place in 
      therapy of liraglutide. METHODS: Literature searches of MEDLINE between 1969 and 
      September 2010, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts between 1970 and September 
      2010, American Diabetes Association Meeting abstracts (2008-2010), and European 
      Association for the Study of Diabetes abstracts (2008-2010) were performed using 
      liraglutide, Victoza, and NN2211 as key terms. RESULTS: Thirteen randomized 
      controlled trials were identified and summarized. Liraglutide has been shown to 
      increase glucose-dependent insulin release by 34% to 118% and reduce postprandial 
      glucagon levels by 20%. Studies showed that liraglutide, as monotherapy and in 
      combination with glimepiride, metformin, and/or rosiglitazone, lowers 
      glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) between 0.84% and 1.5%. Transient nausea was 
      reported by 7% to 40% of subjects. Severe hypoglycemia-glucose <55 mg/dL-was 
      observed by 2.5% of subjects in 1 trial. CONCLUSION: Liraglutide safely and 
      effectively reduces HbA(1c) in patients with type 2 diabetes. The most recent 
      American Diabetes Association guidelines recommended a GLP-1 agonist along with 
      metformin as a second-tier therapy for type 2 diabetes. Although the American 
      Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinologists' 
      guidelines recommended it for first-line monotherapy in patients with HbA(1c) 
      between 6.5% and 7.5% and with metformin if HbA(1c) is between 7.6% and 8.5%, 
      liraglutide should be considered for patients who cannot tolerate first-line 
      agents or if an additional agent is needed to help reach target HbA(1c) goals.

TI  - Advances in the treatment of type 2 diabetes: impact of dulaglutide.
PG  - 125-36
LID - 10.2147/DMSO.S75452 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this review is to provide a review of current data of the most 
      recently approved glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1-receptor agonist, dulaglutide, in 
      the treatment of type 2 diabetes. To complete this, a PubMed search was performed 
      to identify manuscripts published from 1947 to July 2015. The search terms 
      "Trulicity", "dulaglutide", and "LY2189265" were utilized, and publications were 
      included if they evaluated the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, 
      or patient-reported outcomes of dulaglutide. Dulaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor 
      agonist that mimics endogenous GLP-1, the hormone produced in response to food 
      intake. Modifications have been made to the molecule to delay breakdown and allow 
      for once-weekly dosing. Dulaglutide has been studied as monotherapy and in 
      combination with several agents, including metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, 
      and insulin lispro. Dulaglutide has demonstrated superior efficacy compared to 
      placebo, metformin, insulin glargine, sitagliptin, and twice-daily exenatide. It 
      was found to be noninferior to liraglutide. The most common adverse effects in 
      clinical studies were gastrointestinal-related adverse events, and patient 
      satisfaction was high with the use of dulaglutide. Dulaglutide is an appealing 
      option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, based on its once-weekly dosing, A1c 
      lowering comparable to liraglutide, weight reduction comparable to exenatide, and 
      a similar adverse-effect profile to other GLP-1 receptor agonists.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic comparison of a new sustained-release formulation of 
      glimepiride/metformin 1/500 mg combination tablet and a sustained-release 
      formulation of glimepiride/metformin 2/500 mg combination tablet in healthy 
      Korean male volunteers: a randomized, 2-sequence, 2-period, 2-treatment crossover 
      study.
PG  - 1809-18

AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination of glimepiride and metformin is used for glycemic 
      control in patients with diabetes mellitus. A fixed-dose combination of 
      glimepiride/metformin 2/500 mg slow-release (SR) formulation was developed to 
      improve compliance in polymedicated patients. To accommodate the various dosing 
      regimens of glimepiride, a glimepiride/metformin 1/500 mg SR tablet was also 
      developed. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic 
      properties of SR fixed-dose combinations of glimepiride/metformin 2/500 mg and 
      the newly developed glimepiride/metformin 1/500 mg formulation to meet the 
      regulatory requirements for marketing in Korea. METHODS: An open-label, 
      randomized, 2-treatment, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover study was conducted with 
      healthy male volunteers. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to receive a 
      single dose of glimepiride/metformin 1/500 mg SR (test) or glimepiride/metformin 
      2/500 mg SR (reference) followed by a 1-week washout period and then 
      administration of the alternate treatment. Serial blood samples were collected 
      immediately before and after dosing for 30 hours, and plasma concentrations were 
      determined by using LC-MS/MS with validated methods. Adverse events were assessed 
      by subjects' self-report and interviews addressing general health-related issues. 
      Safety profiles were evaluated throughout the study. RESULTS: Thirty-three 
      subjects were enrolled (mean [SD] age: 27.9 [4.95] years [range, 21-40 years]). 
      Safety profiles were assessed for all 32 subjects who were administered the study 
      drugs, and pharmacokinetic characteristics were evaluated in the 30 subjects who 
      completed the study. The geometric mean ratios (90% CIs) of test to reference for 
      the dose-normalized C(max) and AUC(0-last) of glimepiride were 0.98 (0.90-1.07) 
      and 1.06 (0.98-1.14), respectively. In the case of metformin, the geometric mean 
      ratios (90% CIs) of test to reference for C(max) and AUC(0-last) were 1.06 
      (0.98-1.15) and 1.04 (0.97-1.12), respectively. Nine adverse events were 
      reported. Among them, loose stool, abdominal pain, and headache were considered 
      to be likely related to the study drug. All reported adverse events were mild in 
      intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Dose-proportional characteristics of glimepiride and 
      comparable pharmacokinetic properties of metformin were observed between the SR 
      fixed-dose combinations of glimepiride/metformin 1/500 mg and 2/500 mg. A single 
      dose of either treatment was well tolerated, and the safety profiles of the 2 
      treatments were comparable in this small, selected all-male group of healthy 
      Korean volunteers.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to improve the solubility and bioavailability of 
      glimepiride (GLMP) by utilizing hydrotropy technique. Meglumine (MU) as a 
      hydrotrope could form the stable complex with glimepiride. The optimal 
      glimepiride and meglumine (GLMP-MU) complex powder was obtained by using 
      lyophilization. GLMP-MU powder was characterized by Fourier transform infrared 
      spectroscopy (FT IR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning 
      calorimetry (DSC). The formation of hydrogen bond between glimepiride and 
      meglumine was confirmed by FT IR. The XRD studies indicated the amorphous state 
      of glimepiride was appeared in the GLMP-MU. The DSC results were further 
      confirmed GLMP-MU complex was prepared successfully. Moreover, the in vitro drug 
      release rate of GLMP-MU powder was dramatically faster than that of glimepiride. 
      Meanwhile, the AUC of GLMP-MU solution at an i.g./or i.v. dose of 5mg/kg in rat 
      was significantly higher than that of the glimepiride suspensions. Together our 
      results showed that hydrotropy technique was a simple and effective method to 
      increase the solubility of glimepiride.

TI  - Liraglutide: a once-daily incretin mimetic for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus.
PG  - 1433-44
LID - 10.1345/aph.1M134 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of 
      liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analog for the treatment of type 2 
      diabetes mellitus. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search (1966-May 2009) was conducted 
      for English-language articles using the terms glucagon-like peptide 1, incretin 
      mimetic, NN2211, and liraglutide. Abstracts presented at the American Diabetes 
      Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes annual meetings in 
      2006, 2007, and 2008 were also searched for relevant data. STUDY SELECTION AND 
      DATA EXTRACTION: Articles pertinent to the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, 
      efficacy, and safety of liraglutide were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Liraglutide is 
      a GLP-1 analog with pharmacokinetic properties suitable for once-daily 
      administration. Clinical trial data from large, controlled studies demonstrate 
      the effectiveness of liraglutide in terms of hemoglobin A(1c) (A1C) reduction, 
      reductions in body weight, and the drug's low risk for hypoglycemic events when 
      used as monotherapy. Data also support benefits of liraglutide therapy on 
      beta-cell responsiveness to glucose, with animal and in vitro data indicating 
      potential benefits in beta-cell mass and neogenesis with liraglutide treatment. 
      Liraglutide has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, 
      glimepiride, and rosiglitazone for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. 
      Additionally, comparative data with insulin glargine and exenatide therapy are 
      available from Phase 3 trials providing practitioners valuable clinical data on 
      which to base clinical decision making. Overall, liraglutide is well tolerated 
      with dose-dependent nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea being the most commonly 
      reported adverse events in clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily 
      administration may provide a therapeutic advantage for liraglutide over 
      twice-daily exenatide, with similar improvements in A1C and body weight observed 
      when liraglutide was compared with exenatide. The glucose-dependent mechanism of 
      insulin release with GLP-1 agonist therapy holds potential clinical significance 
      in the management of postprandial hyperglycemic excursions, with minimal risk of 
      hypoglycemia.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling of the effects of glimepiride on 
      insulin secretion and glucose lowering in healthy humans.
PG  - 469-76
AB  - Glimepiride is an oral sulfonylurea antihyperglycaemic agent. We used 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modelling to analyse the relationship 
      between plasma glimepiride concentration, insulin secretion and glucose lowering 
      to determine the effects of the drug in healthy volunteers. A single 2-mg oral 
      dose of glimepiride was administered to six healthy volunteers. The control group 
      received a placebo. All subjects consumed 12 g of sugar immediately after drug 
      administration in order to standardize the initial plasma glucose levels. Serial 
      blood sampling was performed for 9 h after oral dosing. Plasma glimepiride, 
      insulin and glucose levels were determined by validated methods (LC/MS/MS assay, 
      hexokinase method and radioimmunoassay respectively). Time courses of plasma 
      glimepiride concentration, insulin secretion, and glucose lowering effects were 
      analysed by means of PK-PD modelling with the ADAPT II program. The time course 
      of the plasma concentrations followed a two-compartmental model with a lag time. 
      The glimepiride concentration peaked at 191.5 ng/mL at approximately 4 h after 
      administration. The maximal increase in insulin secretion was 9.98 mIU/L and the 
      maximal decrease in plasma glucose was 19.33 mg/dL. Both peak effects occurred at 
      approximately 2.5 h after drug intake. The glucose disappearance model was used 
      to analyse glimepiride's insulin secretion and glucose lowering effects. The 
      PK-PD model described well the relationship between plasma glimepiride and its 
      insulin secretion and hypoglycaemic effects in healthy volunteers.

TI  - Glimepiride in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a review of the worldwide therapeutic 
      experience.
PG  - 799-816
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sulfonylureas (SUs) have been used for many years as first-line 
      therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood glucose levels 
      have not been effectively controlled by diet and exercise alone. Glimepiride is a 
      once-daily SU that was introduced in 1995. Since then, a considerable body of 
      evidence has been amassed regarding its use in type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: This 
      review provides a comprehensive summary of available data on the pharmacology, 
      pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety profile of glimepiride in the treatment of 
      type 2 diabetes. It also examines the use of glimepiride to achieve and maintain 
      good glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes in current clinical 
      practice. METHODS: Relevant articles were identified through a search of MEDLINE 
      for English-language studies published from 1990 to 2002. The search terms used 
      were glimepiride, sulfonylureas, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The manufacturer 
      of glimepiride provided additional information. RESULTS: Glimepiride differs from 
      other SUs in a number of respects. In clinical studies, glimepiride was generally 
      associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia and less weight gain than other SUs. 
      Results of other studies suggest that glimepiride can be used in older patients 
      and those with renal compromise. There is evidence that glimepiride preserves 
      myocardial preconditioning, a protective mechanism that limits damage in the 
      event of an ischemic event. Glimepiride can be used in combination with other 
      oral antidiabetic agents or insulin to optimize glycemic control. CONCLUSION: 
      Based on the evidence to date, glimepiride is an effective and well-tolerated 
      once-daily antidiabetic drug and provides an important treatment option for the 
      management of type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Comparative review of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and sulphonylureas.
PG  - 333-47
LID - 10.1111/dom.12610 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a progressive disease, and pharmacotherapy with a 
      single agent does not generally provide durable glycaemic control over the long 
      term. Sulphonylurea (SU) drugs have a history stretching back over 60 years, and 
      have traditionally been the mainstay choice as second-line agents to be added to 
      metformin once glycaemic control with metformin monotherapy deteriorates; 
      however, they are associated with undesirable side effects, including increased 
      hypoglycaemia risk and weight gain. Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors are, 
      by comparison, more recent, with the first compound being launched in 2006, but 
      the class now globally encompasses at least 11 different compounds. DPP-4 
      inhibitors improve glycaemic control with similar efficacy to SUs, but do not 
      usually provoke hypoglycaemia or weight gain, are relatively free from adverse 
      side effects, and have recently been shown not to increase cardiovascular risk in 
      large prospective safety trials. Because of these factors, DPP-4 inhibitors have 
      become an established therapy for T2DM and are increasingly being positioned 
      earlier in treatment algorithms. The present article reviews these two classes of 
      oral antidiabetic drugs (DPP-4 inhibitors and SUs), highlighting differences and 
      similarities between members of the same class, as well as discussing the 
      potential advantages and disadvantages of the two drug classes. While both 
      classes have their merits, the choice of which to use depends on the 
      characteristics of each individual patient; however, for the majority of 
      patients, DPP-4 inhibitors are now the preferred choice.

AB  - This study was designed to investigate the potency of niosomes, for glimepiride 
      (GLM) encapsulation, aiming at enhancing its oral bioavailability and 
      hypoglycemic efficacy. Niosomes containing nonionic surfactants (NIS) were 
      prepared by thin film hydration technique and characterized. In-vitro release 
      study was performed using a dialysis technique. In-vivo pharmacodynamic studies, 
      as well as pharmacokinetic evaluation were performed on alloxan-induced diabetic 
      rats. GLM niosomes exhibited high-entrapment efficiency percentages (E.E. %) up 
      to 98.70% and a particle size diameter ranging from 186.8 ± 18.69 to 
      797.7 ± 12.45 nm, with negatively charged zeta potential (ZP). Different GLM 
      niosomal formulation showed retarded in vitro release, compared to free drug. 
      In-vivo studies revealed the superiority of GLM niosomes in lowering blood 
      glucose level (BGL) and in maintaining a therapeutic level of GLM for a longer 
      period of time, as compared to free drug and market product. There was no 
      significant difference between mean plasma AUC(0-48 hr) of GLM-loaded niosomes 
      and that of market product. GLM-loaded niosomes exhibited seven-fold enhancement 
      in relative bioavailability in comparison with free drug. These findings 
      reinforce the potential use of niosomes for enhancing the oral bioavailability 
      and prolonged delivery of GLM via oral administration.

      to the family of sulfonylurea derivatives. It is used in type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus. Compliance adherence remains one of the limitations with the 
      conventional drug delivery system especially in pediatric, geriatric, 
      psychiatric, and traveling patients, for such population ODT provides a good 
      alternate dosage form compared with Commercial Tablets. METHOD: The Comparative 
      in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters of the prepared ODT and conventional tablets 
      (CT) were evaluated using an animal model. The plasma concentration of 
      Glimepiride after oral administration of a single dose was determined at 
      predetermined time intervals with HPLC. The pharmacokinetic parameters were 
      calculated using PK Solutions 2.0 from Summit PK® software. RESULTS: The Cmax 
      obtained with ODT (22.08 µg/ml) was significantly (p = 0.006) high, a lower tmax 
      of 3.0 hr was achieved with the orodispersable formulation of the drug. The ODT 
      showed 104.34% relative bioavailability as compared to CT and left shift of tmax 
      as well. CONCLUSION: As per findings of the in vivo investigation, the 
      Glimepiride ODT would be beneficial in terms of patient compliance, quick onset 
      of action, and increased bioavailability.

TI  - Comparison of the bioavailability and tolerability of fixed-dose combination 
      glimepiride/metformin 2/500-mg tablets versus separate tablets: A single-dose, 
      randomized-sequence, open-label, two-period crossover study in healthy Korean 
      volunteers.
PG  - 1408-18

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared the bioavailability and tolerability of a 
      fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet of glimepiride/metformin 2/500 mg and 
      glimepiride 2-mg + metformin 500-mg tablets administered separately in healthy 
      Korean subjects. METHODS: In this single-dose, open-label, 2-period crossover 
      study, healthy Korean volunteers were randomly assigned to receive, in 1 of 2 
      randomized sequences, an FDC tablet of glimepiride/metformin 2/500 mg (test) and 
      glimepiride 2-mg + metformin 500-mg tablets administered separately (reference), 
      with a 1-week washout period between treatments. Plasma concentrations of 
      glimepiride and metformin were measured using LC/MS-MS. Pharmacokinetic 
      parameters were analyzed using noncompartmental methods. Bioequivalence was 
      concluded if the 90% CIs of the geometric mean test/reference ratios (GMRs) of 
      the logarithm-transformed C(max), AUC from 0 to 30 hours (AUC(0-30)), and 
      AUC(0-infinity) values were within the predetermined regulatory range of 80% to 
      125%. Tolerability was assessed using physical examination and laboratory 
      analysis. RESULTS: A total of 32 subjects were enrolled (16 men [mean (SD) age, 
      21.8 (2.7) years (range, 18-26 years); weight, 68.9 (8.3) kg (range, 55.5-85.0 
      kg)]; 16 women [age, 23.5 (4.5) years (range, 20-38 years); weight, 51.7 (3.5) kg 
      (range, 46.8-58.0 kg)]). The GMRs (90% CI) of glimepiride C(max), AUC(0-30), and 
      AUC(0-infinity) were 1.01 (0.91-1.11), 0.98 (0.92-1.03), and 0.97 (0.93-1.04), 
      respectively. For metformin, these values were 0.96 (0.87-1.06), 0.96 
      (0.90-1.03), and 0.96 (0.90-1.03). A total of 49 adverse events (AEs) were 
      reported in 10 subjects (31.3%) with the FDC and in 13 subjects (40.6%) with the 
      separate tablets. The most commonly reported AEs with the test and reference 
      treatments were dizziness (6 [19%] and 7 [22%]) and sweating (4 [13%] and 7 
      [22%]), respectively. The severity of all of the AEs was considered to be mild, 
      and there were no significant differences in the prevalences of AEs between the 2 
      formulations. CONCLUSIONS: In this study in healthy Korean subjects, the 
      requirements for bioequivalence of the glimepiride/metformin 2/500-mg FDC and 
      coadministration of separate tablets of each drug were met. Both formulations 
      were generally well tolerated.

TI  - Simultaneous determination of atorvastatin, metformin and glimepiride in human 
      plasma by LC-MS/MS and its application to a human pharmacokinetic study.
PG  - 9-19
LID - 10.1016/j.jpha.2012.09.002 [doi]
AB  - A simple, rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric 
      (LC-MS/MS) assay method has been developed and fully validated for the 
      simultaneous quantification of atorvastatin, metformin and glimepiride in human 
      plasma. Carbamazepine was used as internal standard (IS). The analytes were 
      extracted from 200 μL aliquots of human plasma via protein precipitation using 
      acetonitrile. The reconstituted samples were chromatographed on a Alltima HP C18 
      column by using a 60:40 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile and 10 mM ammonium acetate 
      (pH 3.0) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.1 mL/min. The calibration curves 
      obtained were linear (r(2) ≥0.99) over the concentration range of 
      0.50-150.03 ng/mL for atorvastatin, 12.14-1207.50 ng/mL for metformin and 
      4.98-494.29 ng/mL for glimepiride. The API-4000 LC-MS/MS in multiple reaction 
      monitoring (MRM) mode was used for detection. The results of the intra- and 
      inter-day precision and accuracy studies were well within the acceptable limits. 
      All the analytes were found to be stable in a battery of stability studies. The 
      method is precise and sensitive enough for its intended purpose. A run time of 
      2.5 min for each sample made it possible to analyze more than 300 plasma samples 
      per day. The developed assay method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic 
      study in human male volunteers.

TI  - Dulaglutide: the newest GLP-1 receptor agonist for the management of type 2 
      diabetes.
PG  - 351-9
LID - 10.1177/1060028014564180 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of 
      the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), dulaglutide, in the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). DATA SOURCES: A PubMed search was 
      completed to identify publications from 1947 to October 2014 using the search 
      terms dulaglutide and LY2189265. References were reviewed to identify additional 
      resources. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were included if they 
      evaluated the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, or efficacy of dulaglutide. 
      DATA SYNTHESIS: Dulaglutide reduces both glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) and weight 
      by stimulating insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon in a glucose-dependent 
      manner, delaying gastric emptying, and promoting satiety. Dulaglutide consists of 
      2 GLP-1 analogues that have been modified to make it a long-acting, once-weekly 
      agent. Dulaglutide has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with 
      metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, and insulin lispro. It has demonstrated 
      superior A1C reduction compared with placebo, metformin, insulin glargine, 
      sitagliptin, and twice-daily exenatide. It demonstrated noninferiority in A1C 
      reduction to liraglutide. Dulaglutide changed A1C by -0.78% to -1.51%, and it 
      changed weight by -0.35 kg to -3.03 kg. The most common adverse effects in 
      clinical studies were nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: Dulaglutide is 
      the fifth GLP-1 RA approved for T2D in the United States. It is an attractive 
      option because it is dosed once-weekly, provides A1C lowering similar to 
      liraglutide, weight reduction similar to exenatide, and has an adverse effect 
      profile similar to exenatide and liraglutide.

TI  - Multi-objective optimization strategy based on desirability functions used for 
      electrophoratic separation and quantification of rosiglitazone and glimepiride in 
      plasma and formulations.
PG  - 39-47
LID - 10.1002/dta.260 [doi]
AB  - Multiple response simultaneous optimization employing Derringer's desirability 
      function was used for the development of a capillary electrophoresis method for 
      the simultaneous determination of rosiglitazone (RSG) and glimepiride (GLM) in 
      plasma and formulations. Twenty experiments, taking the two resolutions, the 
      analysis time, and the capillary current as the responses with three important 
      factors--buffer morality, volte and column temperature--were used to design 
      mathematical models. The experimental responses were fitted into a second order 
      polynomial and the six responses were simultaneously optimized to predict the 
      optimum conditions for the effective separation of the studied compounds. The 
      separation was carried out by using capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) with a 
      silica capillary column and diode array detector at 210 nm. The optimum assay 
      conditions were 52 mmol l⁻¹ phosphate buffer, pH 7, and voltage of 22 kV at 29 
      °C. The method showed good agreement between the experimental data and predictive 
      value throughout the studied parameter space. The assay limit of detection was 
      0.02 µg ml⁻¹ and the effective working range at relative standard deviation (RSD) 
      of ≤ 5% was 0.05-16 µg ml⁻¹ (r = 0.999) for both drugs. Analytical recoveries of 
      the studied drugs from spiked plasma were 97.2-101.9 ± 0.31-3.0%. The precision 
      of the assay was satisfactory; RSD was 1.07 and 1.14 for intra- and inter-assay 
      precision, respectively. The proposed method has a great value in routine 
      analysis of RSG and GLM for its therapeutic monitoring and pharmacokinetic 
      studies.

AB  - In this study, the core-shell polydopamine-coated magnetic nanomaterials were 
      synthesized with one-step approach and applied as magnetic solid phase extraction 
      adsorbents combined with LCMS/MS for quantification of the diabetes drug 
      glimepiride in beagle dog plasma. The Fe(3)O(4)@PDA nanomaterials have strong 
      magnetic response, good dispersibility in aqueous solution, and numerous binding 
      sites for π-π interaction and hydrogen bonding with glimepiride. Based on these 
      merits, glimepiride could be quickly extracted and separated from plasma within 
      10min. The established method has good linearity (1-2000ng•mL(-1)), low 
      quantification limit (1ng•mL(-1)), good precision (RSDs≤12 %), and satisfactory 
      extraction recovery (71.20-85.70 %). Moreover, we successfully applied this 
      method to the bioequivalence study of generic and innovator products of 
      glimepiride in beagle dog plasma.

PG  - 28-34

AB  - AIMS: To review the non-glycaemic effects of liraglutide, including potential 
      improvements in body weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pancreatic 
      beta-cell function. KEY FINDINGS: Liraglutide induced weight loss of around 2-3 
      kg compared with weight increases of 1-2 kg with active comparators such as 
      insulin glargine, rosiglitazone and glimepiride. Exenatide demonstrated similar 
      weight benefits to liraglutide, but the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) 
      inhibitors, sitagliptin, saxagliptin and vildagliptin, were weight neutral. 
      Liraglutide was associated with decreases in SBP of 2-7 mmHg, whereas exenatide, 
      vildagliptin and sitagliptin demonstrated SBP reductions of around 2-3 mmHg. 
      Measures of pancreatic beta-cell function were improved with liraglutide vs. 
      placebo, rosiglitazone and exenatide. However, DPP-4 inhibitors appear to have 
      less effect on beta-cell function than glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor 
      agonists. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to glycaemic control, liraglutide and the 
      other incretin-based therapies offer additional non-glycaemic benefits to varying 
      degrees. The ability of GLP-1 receptor agonists to provide modest, but clinically 
      relevant improvements in body weight and SBP, and to potentially benefit 
      beta-cell function make them an exciting therapeutic option for individuals with 
      diabetes. In contrast, DPP-4 inhibitors are weight neutral and may have lesser 
      benefits on beta-cell function.

AB  - Fused Deposition Modelling (a.k.a. FDM-3D printing) has been previously employed 
      in the development of personalized medicines with unique properties and release 
      behavior. In the present work, a bilayer dosage form containing two anti-diabetic 
      drugs with different daily dosage regimens; i.e. metformin and glimepiride, was 
      manufactured via FDM 3D printing, studied using a variety of techniques and 
      characterized in vitro. Metformin and glimepiride were embedded in Eudragit® RL 
      sustained release layer and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) layer respectively. 
      Incorporation of more than one API's into the formulation is desirable, as it 
      increases patient compliance and reduces cost of treatment, especially when 
      distinct dosages of API's can be adjusted individually in situ, in order to meet 
      each patient's specific needs, a capability provided by 3D printing. A number of 
      different preparation methods, which involved different plasticizers and 
      extruders, were tested on manufacturing Eudragit® RL drug-loaded filaments for 
      printing the sustained release layer. The properties of the produced filaments 
      were assessed by means of mechanical and physicochemical characterization 
      techniques and the filaments with the optimum properties were used for printing. 
      Microfocus computed tomography (μCT) imaging-based actual/nominal comparison 
      analysis showed a printing accuracy ranging between -100, +200 μm, while X-ray 
      (XRD) diffractograms revealed the incorporation of the (initially crystalline) 
      API's as amorphous dispersions into polymer matrices. Dissolution tests showed 
      sufficient drug release for both drugs in desired time frames (75 min for 
      glimepiride and 480 min for metformin). The results from the current study 
      emphasize the potentiality of 3D printing technology for tailor-made solid dosage 
      forms for combined pharmacotherapy, even at the cases when API's with different 
      desirable release profiles are employed.

TI  - Dapagliflozin for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
PG  - 1202-1208
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, and 
      adverse effects of dapagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) 
      inhibitor. DATA SOURCES: Data were gathered from articles indexed in PubMed, 
      International Pharmaceutical from (2006 to April 2014) was performed using the 
      following terms "dapagliflozin," "SGLT-2 inhibitor," and "Farxiga." Abstracts and 
      manufacturer's package insert were also used as an additional reference. STUDY 
      SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All English language prospective randomized, 
      double-blinded trials evaluating the efficacy of dapagliflozin for the treatment 
      of type 2 diabetes were identified. DATA SYNTHESIS: We evaluated 9 clinical 
      trials with dapagliflozin as monotherapy or add-on therapy. Results from these 
      studies demonstrated that dapagliflozin to be noninferior to metformin in 
      treatment naïve patients for reduction in A1C. Additionally, dapagliflozin was 
      noninferior to glimepiride when added on to metformin. As an add-on therapy to 
      insulin, insulin sensitizers or sitagliptin, dapagliflozin was found to be 
      clinically effective compared to placebo. Finally, in all of the clinical trials 
      increased risk of urinary infection was common in dapagliflozin group. 
      CONCLUSION: As the second SGLT-2 inhibitor approved in the United States, 
      dapagliflozin is safe and effective for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It 
      appears to have no increased cardiovascular risk and provides a moderate benefit 
      for patients with high blood pressure or those who are overweight. However, 
      dapagliflozin was found to be associated with nasopharyngitis, mycotic 
      infections, and genital or urinary tract infections. This medication may be best 
      used as adjunctive therapy for patients not well-controlled on other antidiabetic 
      agents. However, caution should be taken when used in patients at risk of urinary 
      tract infections and dehydration.

TI  - Linagliptin: a review of its use in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1793-824
LID - 10.2165/11209570-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - Linagliptin (Trajenta®, Tradjenta™, Trazenta™, Trayenta™) is an oral, highly 
      selective inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and is the first agent of its class 
      to be eliminated predominantly via a nonrenal route. Linagliptin is indicated for 
      once-daily use for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a 
      twice-daily fixed-dose combination of linagliptin/metformin (Jentadueto®) is also 
      available. In this article, the pharmacological, clinical efficacy and 
      tolerability data relevant to the use of linagliptin in patients with type 2 
      diabetes are reviewed. The efficacy of oral linagliptin in the treatment of 
      adults with type 2 diabetes has been investigated in several double-blind, 
      multicentre trials. Following 12-24 weeks of treatment, improvements in glycaemic 
      control parameters, including glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c); primary endpoint 
      in all trials), were seen with linagliptin relative to placebo when used as 
      monotherapy, initial combination therapy (with metformin or pioglitazone) or 
      add-on therapy to other oral antihyperglycaemia agents (metformin and/or a 
      sulfonylurea) or basal insulin (with or without metformin and/or pioglitazone). 
      In terms of lowering HbA(1c), linagliptin was more effective than voglibose in a 
      26-week monotherapy trial and noninferior to glimepiride when used as add-on 
      therapy to metformin in a 104-week study. Additional trials and subgroup analyses 
      of pooled data suggest that linagliptin improves glycaemic control regardless of 
      factors such as age, duration of type 2 diabetes, ethnicity and renal function, 
      and as linagliptin is eliminated primarily via a nonrenal route, it can be used 
      without dosage adjustment in patients with renal impairment of any degree. Oral 
      linagliptin was generally well tolerated and was associated with a low likelihood 
      of hypoglycaemia (except when used in combination with a sulfonylurea) and had 
      little effect on bodyweight. Further long-term and comparative efficacy and 
      tolerability data are required to help position linagliptin more definitively 
      with respect to other antihyperglycaemia agents. However, clinical data currently 
      available indicate that linagliptin is an effective and generally well tolerated 
      treatment option for use in patients with type 2 diabetes, including those with 
      renal impairment for whom other antihyperglycaemia agents require dosage 
      adjustment or are not suitable.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic basis for the safety of glimepiride in risk groups of NIDDM 
      patients.
PG  - 434-9
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of the sulfonylurea, glimepiride, in risk groups of NIDDM 
      patients are reviewed with regard to pharmacokinetic-effect relationships. A 
      variety of factors, such as regulatory processes, glucose absorption, insulin 
      sensitivity, might prevent the definition of a clear concentration-effect 
      relationship for sulfonylureas. However, when these processes are minimized, as 
      with the glucose clamp technique, such relationships can be defined. This is true 
      for glibenclamide or glimepiride, for which saturation of effect is apparent in 
      the upper therapeutic dose range in healthy subjects. However, 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships are less readily defined during 
      long-term treatment of NIDDM patients. In kidney or liver disease, the 
      hypoglycemic effect of sulfonylureas can be increased and prolonged, mainly due 
      to a decrease in insulin metabolism or of hepatic glucose output; the risk of 
      hypoglycemia is increased. The pharmacokinetics of most sulfonylureas have not 
      been well characterised in patients with kidney or liver disease. Generally, 
      sulfonylureas are eliminated by renal excretion of metabolites, some of which 
      have similar pharmacological activity to the parent drug e.g. glibenclamide, 
      chlorpropamide, tolbutamide. In renal disease, elimination of these metabolites 
      can be impaired. In 31 NIDDM patients with kidney disease, elimination of 
      unchanged glimepiride was greater in patients with more severe renal disease, 
      probably due to a decrease in the plasma protein-bound fraction. Elimination of 
      the renally excreted metabolites was also impaired in the same group of patients. 
      12 of 16 NIDDM patients with kidney disease who continued glimepiride treatment 
      for three months maintained fasting blood glucose levels of less than 9.99 mmol/l 
      at a daily dose of 1-6 mg, the typical dose range for patients with normal renal 
      function. Pharmacokinetic data on sulfonylureas are generally inconsistent in 
      cirrhotic patients. In 11 patients with liver disease, the pharmacokinetics of 
      glimepiride were similar to those of healthy volunteers. In conclusion, 
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and their relationships can be defined for 
      glimepiride under controlled conditions. Such information is lacking for many 
      commonly used sulfonylureas in risk group NIDDM patients. Studies described here 
      show that the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride are altered in renal disease but 
      may not be seriously affected in patients with liver disease.

      bioavailabilities of the antidiabetic drugs pioglitazone and glimepiride present 
      in a fixed-dose combination formulation.
PG  - 806-16
AB  - An open-label, randomized, 2-sequence, 4-period crossover (7-day washout period 
      between treatment), replicate design study was conducted in 37 healthy subjects 
      to assess intersubject and intrasubject variabilities in the peak (Cmax) and 
      total (AUC) exposures to 2 oral antidiabetic drugs, pioglitazone and glimepiride, 
      after single doses of 30 mg pioglitazone and 4 mg glimepiride, given under fasted 
      state, as commercial tablets coadministered or as a single fixed-dose combination 
      tablet. Variabilities for AUC(infinity) for coadministered and fixed-dose 
      combination treatments were similar: 16% to 19% (intra) and 23% to 25% (inter) 
      for pioglitazone and 18% to 19% (intra) and 29% to 30% for glimepiride (inter, 
      excluding 1 poor metabolizer). Fixed-dose combination/coadministered least 
      squares mean ratios of >or=0.86 and the 90% confidence intervals of these ratios 
      for pioglitazone and glimepiride of between 0.80 and 1.25 for Cmax, AUC(lqc), and 
      AUC(infinity) met the bioequivalency standards. Gender analysis showed that women 
      showed mean of 16% and 30% higher exposure than men for glimepiride (excluding 1 
      poor metabolizer) and pioglitazone, respectively. There was considerable 
      overlapping in the AUC(infinity) values, making gender-dependent dosing 
      unnecessary. Patients taking pioglitazone and glimepiride as cotherapy may 
      replace their medication with a single fixed-dose combination tablet containing 
      these 2 oral antidiabetic drugs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bioavailability is the dissimilarity between the total amount of drug 
      exposure to a person and the actual dose received by his body. The difference in 
      bioavailability between formulations of a given drug can have clinical 
      implications. METHODS: Poor aqueous solubility, inappropriate partition 
      coefficient, high first-pass metabolism, narrow absorption window, and acidic pH 
      of the stomach are the main reasons behind the low bioavailability of drugs. 
      There are three substantial methods to vanquish these bioavailability issues, 
      namely pharmacokinetic, biological, and pharmaceutical approaches. RESULTS: In 
      the pharmacokinetic approach a drug molecule is improved by making alterations in 
      its chemical structure. In the biological approach, the course of administration 
      of the drug is changed; for example, if a drug has very less oral 
      bioavailability, it can be injected as parenteral or some other route if 
      feasible. In the pharmaceutical approach to enhance bioavailability, the 
      physiochemical properties of the drug or formulation are modified. It is 
      cost-effective, less time-consuming, and the risk factor is also minimum. 
      Co-solvency, particle size reduction, hydrotrophy, solid dispersion, micellar 
      solubilisation, complexation, and colloidal drug delivery systems are some of the 
      commonly used methods to enhance the dissolution profiles of drugs via the 
      pharmaceutical approach. Similar to liposomes, niosomes are also vesicular 
      carrier systems but non-ionic surfactants are used instead of phospholipids in 
      their formulation, i.e., their bilayer is comprised of non-ionic surfactants that 
      encircle the aqueous compartment. The niosomes are presumed to raise the 
      bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs by increasing their uptake by the M 
      cells present in Peyer's patches of lymphatic tissues of the intestine. 
      CONCLUSION: Niosomal technology has become an attractive method to overcome 
      several limitations due to its various merits like biodegradability, high 
      stability, non-immunogenic nature, low cost, and flexibility to incorporate 
      lipophilic as well as hydrophilic drugs. The bioavailability of many BCS class II 
      and IV drugs has been successfully enhanced using niosomal technology, like 
      Griseofulvin, Paclitaxel, Candesartan Cilexetil, Carvedilol, Clarithromycin, 
      Telmisartan, and Glimepiride. Niosomal technology has also been exploited for 
      brain targeting via nasal delivery for many drugs like Nefopam, Pentamidine, 
      Ondansetron HCl, and Bromocriptine mesylate. Based on this data, it can be 
      concluded that niosomal technology has increased importance in bioavailability 
      enhancement and improving the overall performance of molecules in vitro and in 
      vivo. Thus, niosomal technology holds tremendous potential for scale-up 
      applications, overcoming the drawbacks of conventional dosage forms.

TI  - Sulphonylureas in the management of type 2 diabetes during the fasting month of 
      Ramadan.
PG  - 444-6
AB  - Although a majority of Muslim patients with type 2 diabetes fast during the month 
      of Ramadan, there are no accepted guidelines for its management during this 
      period. The few studies on this subject suggest that there are important 
      alterations in energy intake and physical activity, and that most patients change 
      their pattern of drug intake. This is associated with a greater risk of 
      hypoglycaemia and ketoacidosis. The usual pattern of eating during Ramadan, and 
      its influence on the normal diurnal variation of blood sugar with a regular 
      non-fasting diabetic diet, suggests that anti-diabetic agents for use during this 
      period need to be selected according to their pharmacokinetic and tablet 
      formulation characteristics. The sulphonylureas are first line drugs in type 2 
      diabetes and used by a majority of patients. A comparison of the 
      pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety characteristics of these agents suggests 
      that a long-acting once daily formulation of gliclazide such as gliclazide 
      modified release, taken in the evening, may be the sulphonylurea of choice during 
      Ramadan.

TI  - Simultaneous determination of the sulphonylurea glimepiride and its metabolites 
      in human serum and urine by high-performance liquid chromatography after 
      pre-column derivatization.
PG  - 497-505
AB  - A sensitive and selective high-performance liquid chromatographic method has been 
      developed for a new sulphonylurea, glimepiride, and its metabolites. The assay 
      involves extraction with diethyl ether, thermolysis of the sulphonylureas at 100 
      degrees C and trapping of the resulting amines with 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene. The 
      derivatives were quantitated on a reversed-phase column by absorbance at 350 nm 
      using a step gradient for the three compounds in serum and an isocratic run for 
      the metabolites in urine. Analogous compounds were used as internal standards. 
      The detection limit was 5 ng/ml for glimepiride and metabolite II and 10 ng/ml 
      for metabolite I using 1 ml of serum. The method has been applied to the analysis 
      of serum and urine samples from pharmacokinetic studies in humans.

TI  - Repaglinide: a review of its use in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 249-72
LID - 10.2165/11207600-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - Oral repaglinide (GlucoNorm®; NovoNorm®; Prandin®; Surepost®) is a rapid-acting 
      insulin secretagogue that lowers postprandial glucose (PPG) excursions by 
      targeting early-phase insulin release, with reductions in PPG considered to be 
      important in reducing long-term cardiovascular complications of diabetes 
      mellitus. Repaglinide, a carbamoylbenzoic acid derivative, is chemically related 
      to the meglitinide class of insulin secretagogues, but unrelated to the 
      sulfonylurea insulin secretagogues. Meglitinides, including repaglinide, have a 
      distinct binding site at the β-cell membrane, which differs from that of 
      sulfonylureas, and corresponds to greater insulinotropic effects with repaglinide 
      than with glibenclamide and/or glimepiride and a more rapid onset of action in in 
      vitro and in vivo studies. This article reviews the clinical efficacy and 
      tolerability of oral repaglinide in the treatment of patients with type 2 
      diabetes and provides an overview of its pharmacological properties. In well 
      designed clinical trials of up to 52 weeks' duration and in the clinical practice 
      setting, recommended dosages of repaglinide (0.5-4 mg three times daily up to 
      30 minutes prior to a meal) provided effective glycaemic control and were 
      generally well tolerated in treatment-naive or -experienced adult patients with 
      type 2 diabetes, including elderly patients and those with renal impairment. 
      Furthermore, as monotherapy or in combination with other oral antihyperglycaemic 
      drugs, repaglinide was at least as effective as other oral antihyperglycaemic 
      drugs at improving or maintaining glycaemic control, with a tolerability profile 
      that was generally similar to that of sulfonylurea drugs and nateglinide. Thus, 
      repaglinide remains an effective option for the management of patients with type 
      2 diabetes.

TI  - Transdermal Delivery of Glimepiride: A Novel Approach Using Nanomicelle-Embedded 
      Microneedles.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics15082019 [doi]
LID - 2019
AB  - Glimepiride (GM) is a hydrophobic drug that dissolves slowly and yields 
      inconsistent clinical responses after oral administration. Transdermal drug 
      delivery (TDD) is an appropriate alternative to oral administration. Microneedles 
      (MNs) offer a promising delivery system that penetrates the skin, while polymeric 
      micelles can enhance the solubility; hence, the combination of both results in 
      high drug bioavailability. This study aims to improve glimepiride's solubility, 
      dissolution rate, and bioavailability by incorporating nanomicelles into MNs for 
      TDD. The nanomicelles formulated with 10% Soluplus(®) (SP) and 40% GM had a mean 
      particle size of 82.6 ± 0.54, PDI of 0.1 ± 0.01, -16.2 ± 0.18 zeta potential, and 
      achieved a 250-fold increase in solubility. The fabricated pyramid shaped 
      GM-dissolving MNs were thermally stable and had no formulation incompatibility, 
      as confirmed by thermal and FTIR analysis. The in vitro dissolution profile 
      revealed that the GM release from nanomicelles and nanomicelle-loaded DMN was 
      concentration-independent following non-Fickian transport mechanism. Improved 
      pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained with dose of 240 µg as compared to 1 mg 
      of GM oral tablet, in healthy human volunteers. The observed C(max), T(max) and 
      MRT were 1.56 μg/mL ± 0.06, 4 h, and 40.04 h ± 3.37, respectively. The safety 
      profile assessment indicated that microneedles are safe with no adverse effects 
      on skin or health. This study provides an alternative delivery system for the 
      administration of glimepiride, resulting in improved bioavailability, enhanced 
      patient compliance, and reduced dosing frequency.

TI  - Therapeutic effect of atorvastatin on kidney functions and urinary excretion of 
      Glimepiride in healthy adult human male subjects.
PG  - 2321-2326
AB  - Glimepiride and atorvastatin in combination are commonly employed for treating 
      the hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia, respectively, in patients of type 2 diabetes. 
      The present study was designed to find out the influence of atorvastatin on 
      urinary excretion and renal clearance of Glimepiride in healthy adult male 
      volunteers. In each experimental subject, Glimepiride 2mg was given orally after 
      an overnight fasting. Samples of blood and urine were taken at different specific 
      time intervals. After a washout period of ten days, Glimepiride 2mg was 
      co-administered with atorvastatin 20mg orally. Post-medication, blood and urine 
      samples were collected following the same sampling schedule as for Glimepiride 
      alone. The samples were analyzed for Glimepiride and creatinine concentration by 
      HPLC-UV and Spectrophotometer, respectively. Mean (±SE) values for blood pH 
      7.445±0.05 and 7.382±0.05, urine pH 4.972±0.08 and 5.08±0.10, diuresis 
      0.0207±0.00 and 0.0237±0.00ml/min/kg, endogenous creatinine in plasma 9.048±0.33 
      and 8.613±0.024µg/ml, endogenous creatinine in urine 512.34±18.20 and 
      556.72±4.60µg/ml, Glimepiride plasma concentration 0.16069±0.00 and 
      0.3227±0.01µg/ml, Glimepiride urine concentration 1.5994±0.03 and 
      0.8665±0.04µg/ml, renal clearance of creatinine 1.224±0.09 and 
      1.550±0.09ml/min/kg, renal clearance of Glimepiride 0.2064±0.01 and 
      0.0641±0.00ml/min/kg and clearance ratio 0.1791±0.01 and 0.0414±0.00 were 
      observed for Glimepiride alone and its concurrent administration with 
      atorvastatin, respectively. Atorvastatin decreased the urinary excretion and 
      renal clearance of Glimepiride due to which chances of hypoglycemia provokes and 
      renal handling of Glimepiride involves back diffusion besides glomerular 
      filtration and no influence of atorvastatin was seen on these mechanisms.

TI  - Formulation and biological evaluation of glimepiride-cyclodextrin-polymer 
      systems.
PG  - 129-38
AB  - Glimepiride is one of the third generation sulfonylureas used for treatment of 
      type 2 diabetes. Poor aqueous solubility and slow dissolution rate of the drug 
      lead to irreproducible clinical response or therapeutic failure in some cases due 
      to subtherapeutic plasma drug levels. Consequently, the rationale of this study 
      was to improve the biological performance of this drug through enhancing its 
      solubility and dissolution rate. Inclusion complexes of glimepiride in 
      beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CyD), hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CyD) and 
      sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin (SBE-beta-CyD), with or without water soluble 
      polymers were prepared by the kneading method. Binary systems were characterized 
      by thermogravimetric analysis, IR spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry. Phase 
      solubility diagrams revealed increase in solubility of the drug upon cyclodextrin 
      addition, showing A(p) type plot indicating high order complexation. All the 
      ternary systems containing beta-CyD or HP-beta-CyD showed higher dissolution 
      efficiency compared to the corresponding binary systems. The hypoglycemic effect 
      of the most rapidly dissolving ternary system of glimepiride-HP-beta-CyD-PEG 4000 
      was evaluated after oral administration in diabetic rats by measuring blood 
      glucose levels. The results indicated that this ternary system improves 
      significantly the therapeutic efficacy of the drug. In conclusion, the 
      association of water soluble polymers with glimepiride-CyD systems leads to great 
      enhancement in dissolution rate, increased duration of action and improvement of 
      therapeutic efficacy of the drug.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with concurrent diabetes mellitus (DM) and tuberculosis (TB) 
      pose an increased risk of treatment failure in TB and management of DM is 
      complicated. Anti-diabetic and anti-TB drugs may interact with on another other 
      when co-administered. The role of anti-TB drugs on the excretion of metformin in 
      urine has not been studied. Therefore, we carried out a study in DM patients with 
      and without TB to compare the percentage of metformin excreted in urine. METHODS: 
      A total of 52 DMTB and 17 DM patients were recruited in this study from the 
      Chennai Corporation Centres. DM and DM - TB patients were administered the 
      prescribed anti-TB and anti-diabetic drugs (metformin (MET), glipizide 
      (GLP),glimepiride (GLM),glibenclamide (GLB),rifampicin (RMP),isoniazid (INH), 
      pyrazinamide (PZA) and ethambutol (EMB). DM and DMTB patients received metformin 
      (MET) alone and in combination with sulphonylureas as diabetic drugs. The urine 
      samples were collected from 0 to 8 hours after drug administration. Urine MET 
      excreted in DM and DMTB patients were estimated by high performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC) and percent dose was calculated. RESULTS: The percent dose 
      of MET excreted in urine in DMTB patients was significantly higher when compared 
      to DM patients. There is significant difference in the percent dose of MET 
      excreted among DM patients with and without sulphonylureas, values being 23.3 and 
      17.7% respectively (p = 0.044). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report on 
      the percent dose of MET excretion in urine in patients with DM and DMTB receiving 
      MET along with anti-TB drugs.

TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo performance of locally manufactured glimepiride tablet 
      generics compared to the innovator (Amaryl(®)) tablets.
PG  - 192-199

AB  - Both physicians and patients in Egypt often express concern as to the clinical 
      efficacy of locally manufactured glimepiride tablet generics whenever adequate 
      control of blood sugar is not achieved with these products. The present study 
      addresses this issue. The pharmaceutical quality of four glimepiride 3 mg tablet 
      generics purchased in Egypt from local pharmacies was assessed relative to the 
      innovator product (Amaryl(®)), 3 mg tablets. Uniformity of Content, dissolution 
      rate, disintegration time and hardness were determined. Products were subjected 
      to a 6-month stability study under stress condition (40 °c/75%RH). The same 
      brands were evaluated in vivo in a clinical study conducted in the Main 
      Alexandria University Hospital involving 100 patients (20 patients per brand 
      including innovator). Patients recruited were newly diagnosed type II diabetics. 
      Glimepiride tablets were used as a monotherapy. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and 
      glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) were measured over a period of 3 months. The 
      results indicated differences (p ≤ .05) in the in vitro and in vivo performance 
      of the tested products; innovator and tested generics substitution was not 
      evident. The stability study indicated that the tablets were prone to 
      deterioration in their physical characteristics, particularly dissolution 
      profiles, upon storage of blisters in a hot humid climate. In vitro/in vivo 
      correlations were investigated seeking to identify an in vitro test to serve as a 
      performance indicator for glimepiride tablets in the post-marketing period. The 
      similarity factor (f(2)) of the dissolution data proved to be a good indicator of 
      in vivo performance of the tablets.

AB  - A simple and sensitive method was developed for simultaneous estimation of 
      Glimepiride (GLIM) and Sildenafil citrate (SIL) in rat Plasma by reverse phase 
      high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The drug samples were extracted 
      by liquid-liquid extraction with 300 µl of acetonitrile and 5 ml of diethyl 
      ether. Chromatographic separation was achieved on C18 column using methanol: 
      water (85:15 v/v) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and UV detection at 
      230 nm. The retention time of GLIM and SIL was found to be 2.5 and 4.0 min 
      respectively with total run time of 7 min. The developed method was validated for 
      accuracy, precision, linearity and recovery. The method was linear and found to 
      be acceptable over the range of 100-12 000 ng/ml. The method was successfully 
      applied for the analysis of rat plasma sample for application to pharmacokinetic.

TI  - Bioequivalence and pharmacokinetic evaluation of two formulations of glimepiride 
      2 mg: a single-dose, randomized-sequence, open-label, two-way crossover study in 
      healthy Chinese male volunteers.
PG  - 986-95
LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2010.04.016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glimepiride is an oral sulfonylurea antihyperglycemic agent indicated 
      for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although there are reports in the 
      literature regarding the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of glimepiride, few 
      data of PK parameters are available in a Chinese population; none are available 
      regarding a recently developed generic formulation. OBJECTIVE: To meet the 
      requirements for marketing a new generic product in China, the study was designed 
      to compare the PK properties and bioequivalence of 2-mg tablets of glimepiride: 
      the newly developed generic formulation (test) and a branded formulation 
      (reference) in healthy Chinese male volunteers. METHODS: A single-dose, 
      randomized-sequence, open-label, 2-way crossover study was conducted in fasted 
      healthy Chinese male volunteers. Eligible participants were randomly assigned in 
      a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 tablet (2 mg each) of the test or reference formulation, 
      followed by a 1-week washout period and administration of the alternate 
      formulation. The study drugs were administered after a 10-hour overnight fast. 
      Plasma samples were collected before study drug administration (baseline) and at 
      0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, and 48 hours after study drug 
      administration. Concentrations in plasma of the parent glimepiride and its M1 
      metabolite were analyzed with a LC-MS/MS method. The formulations were considered 
      bioequivalent if the 90% CIs for the log-transformed values were within the 
      predetermined equivalence range (70%-143% for C(max) and 80%-125% for AUC), 
      according to the guidelines of the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) of 
      China. Tolerability was based on the recording of adverse events (AEs), 
      monitoring vital signs, ECGs, and laboratory tests at baseline and completion of 
      the study. RESULTS: A total of 24 healthy Chinese male volunteers were enrolled 
      and completed the study; however, only the data from 23 subjects were included 
      (mean [SD] age, 23.6 [2.2] years [range, 18.6-26.9 years]; weight, 64.0 [8.4] kg 
      [range, 52.0-82.0 kg]; and height, 172.3 [5.6] cm [range, 164.0-185.0 cm) in the 
      PK and tolerability assessments due to a violation of the protocol. For parent 
      glimepiride, the 90% CIs for the ratios of Cmax, AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-infinity) 
      were 93.83% to 115.19%, 90.82% to 102.29%, and 92.22% to 103.78%, respectively. 
      For the M1 metabolite, the 90% CIs were 91.71% to 110.79%, 91.33% to 101.76%, and 
      89.99% to 99.85%. Both met the predetermined criteria for bioequivalence. Four 
      AEs (17.4%) were reported: hypertriglyceridemia (2 subjects [8.7%]; 1 each 
      receiving the test and reference formulations); increase of red blood cells in 
      urine (1 subject [4.3%] receiving the reference formulation); and hypoglycemia (1 
      subject [4.3%] receiving the test formulation). The incidence of hypoglycemia was 
      the only AE considered probably related to study drug administration; all others 
      were considered probably not related. All AEs were transient and considered by 
      the investigators to be mild. CONCLUSIONS: In this small study in fasted healthy 
      Chinese male volunteers, a single 2-mg dose of the test formulation met the 
      regulatory criteria to assume bioequivalence to the reference formulation based 
      on the rate and extent of absorption. Both formulations were well tolerated. SFDA

TI  - Fasiglifam as a new potential treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 2591-600
LID - 10.1517/14656566.2013.851668 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fasiglifam , a novel G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) agonist, 
      has demonstrated glucose-lowering effects in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
      through stimulation of glucose-dependent insulin secretion. AREAS COVERED: This 
      review is based on a PubMed search for all articles on fasiglifam and TAK-875. 
      The pharmacology of fasiglifam is reviewed, focusing on studies in human 
      volunteers and patients with T2DM. All published clinical trials with fasiglifam 
      in T2DM are summarized, including two 12-week dose-ranging studies (one from 
      Japan and the other from Central and North America), both of which employed 
      glimepiride as an active comparator. EXPERT OPINION: Fasiglifam, a novel 
      glucose-dependent insulin secretagogue, is the first GPR40 agonist to enter Phase 
      III clinical evaluation. It has been shown to produce statistically significant 
      and clinically relevant improvements in glycemic control in patients with 
      early-stage T2DM. Furthermore, its tolerability and safety profile was comparable 
      to placebo and no dose-related adverse effects were observed. Importantly, 
      fasiglifam was comparable to placebo with regards to the incidence of 
      hypoglycemia and it produced significantly fewer episodes compared with 
      glimepiride. Fasiglifam is an interesting and novel oral anti-diabetic agent 
      which may offer new avenues for treating T2DM, but clearly more thorough clinical 
      evaluation is still needed.

      glimepiride: development and antidiabetic activity in albino rabbits.
PG  - 499-508
LID - 10.3109/10717544.2013.879753 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: This study presents novel self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system 
      potential of oral delivering which leads poorly aqueous soluble drug glimepiride. 
      OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to prepare solid self-nanoemulsifying 
      drug delivery system (S-SNEDDS) for the improved oral delivery of glimepiride and 
      to evaluate its therapeutic efficacy in albino rabbits. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: 
      The droplet size analyses revealed a droplet size of less than 200 nm. The solid 
      state characterization of S-SNEDDS by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray 
      powder diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed the 
      absence of crystalline glimepiride in the S-SNEDDS. The in vitro dissolution 
      studies revealed that the significant improvement in glimepiride release 
      characteristics. The effect of S-SNEDDS on therapeutic efficacy of glimepride was 
      assessed in albino rabbits by monitoring blood glucose levels and compared with 
      free drug suspension, L-SNEDDS. The S-SNEDDS showed significant (p < 0.05) 
      increase in in vitro drug release and therapeutic efficacy as compared with free 
      drug. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that S-SNEDDS is a promising novel drug 
      delivery system of glimepride to enhance oral delivery.

TI  - Meglitinide analogues in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 411-25
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex heterogenous metabolic disorder in which 
      peripheral insulin resistance and impaired insulin release are the main 
      pathogenetic factors. The rapid response of the pancreatic beta-cells to glucose 
      is already markedly disturbed in the early stages of type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
      The consequence is often postprandial hyperglycaemia, which seems to be extremely 
      important in the development of secondary complications, especially macrovascular 
      disease. Therefore one of the main aims of treatment is to minimise blood glucose 
      oscillations and attain near-normal glycosylated haemoglobin levels. Meglitinide 
      analogues belong to a new family of insulin secretagogues which stimulate insulin 
      release by inhibiting ATP-sensitive potassium channels of the beta-cell membrane 
      via binding to a receptor distinct from that of sulphonylureas (SUR1/KIR 6.2). 
      The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of repaglinide, the first drug 
      of these new antihyperglycaemic agents on the market, and of nateglinide, which 
      will be available soon, differ markedly from the currently used sulphonylureas 
      [mainly glibenclamide (glyburide) and glimepiride]. Repaglinide and nateglinide 
      are absorbed rapidly, stimulate insulin release within a few minutes, are rapidly 
      metabolised in the liver and are mainly excreted in the bile. Therefore, 
      following preprandial administration of these drugs, insulin is more readily 
      available during and just after the meal. This leads to a significant reduction 
      in postprandial hyperglycaemia without the danger of hypoglycaemia between meals. 
      The short action of these compounds and biliary elimination makes repaglinide and 
      nateglinide especially suitable for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who 
      would like to have a more flexible lifestyle, need more flexibility because of 
      unplanned eating behaviour (e.g. geriatric patients) or in whom one of the other 
      first-line antidiabetic drugs, i.e. metformin, is strictly contraindicated (e.g. 
      nephropathy with creatinine clearance < or = 50 ml/min). Meglitinide analogues 
      act synergistically with metformin and thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and 
      rosiglitazone) and can be also combined with long-acting insulin (NPH insulin at 
      bedtime). Therefore, these drugs enrich the palette of antidiabetic drugs and 
      make the treatment more flexible and better tolerated, which both add to better 
      metabolic control and support the empowerment and compliance of the patient. 
      However, this will only be the case if the patient and the diabetes care team are 
      trained for this new therapeutic schedule and the healthcare system is able to 
      pay for these rather expensive drugs.

TI  - Solubility Enhancement of Antidiabetic Drugs Using a Co-Crystallization Approach.
PG  - 1260-1268
LID - 10.1002/open.202100246 [doi]
AB  - The co-crystallization approach has been used to enhance specific desirable 
      properties of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) such as solubility, 
      dissolution rate, and stability. Solubility is a fundamental property that 
      affects the bioavailability and dosage of the API. The co-crystal approach is one 
      of the emerging methods with the potential for improving the solubility of these 
      drugs. This paper reviews the latest progress on improving the solubility of some 
      antidiabetic drug molecules using the co-crystal approach.

TI  - Overview of the Clinical Pharmacology of Ertugliflozin, a Novel Sodium-Glucose 
      Cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) Inhibitor.
PG  - 949-965
LID - 10.1007/s40262-020-00875-1 [doi]
AB  - Ertugliflozin, a selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), 
      is approved in the US, EU, and other regions for the treatment of adults with 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This review summarizes the ertugliflozin 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic data obtained during phase I clinical 
      development, which supported the registration and labeling of this drug. The PK 
      of ertugliflozin was similar in healthy subjects and patients with T2DM. Oral 
      absorption was rapid, with time to peak plasma concentrations (T(max)) occurring 
      at 1 h (fasted) and 2 h (fed) postdose. The terminal phase half-life ranged from 
      11 to 18 h and steady-state concentrations were achieved by 6 days after 
      initiating once-daily dosing. Ertugliflozin exposure increased in a 
      dose-proportional manner over the tested dose range of 0.5-300 mg. Ertugliflozin 
      is categorized as a Biopharmaceutical Classification System Class I drug with an 
      absolute bioavailability of ~ 100% under fasted conditions. Administration of the 
      ertugliflozin 15 mg commercial tablet with food resulted in no meaningful effect 
      on ertugliflozin area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), but 
      decreased peak concentrations (C(max)) by 29%. The effect on C(max) is not 
      clinically relevant and ertugliflozin can be administered without regard to food. 
      Mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment were associated with a ≤ 70% increase 
      in ertugliflozin exposure relative to subjects with normal renal function, and no 
      dose adjustment in renal impairment patients is needed based on PK results. 
      Consistent with the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors, 24-h urinary glucose 
      excretion decreased with worsening renal function. In subjects with moderate 
      hepatic impairment, a decrease in AUC (13%) relative to subjects with normal 
      hepatic function was observed and not considered clinically relevant. Concomitant 
      administration of metformin, sitagliptin, glimepiride, or simvastatin with 
      ertugliflozin did not have clinically meaningful effects on the PK of 
      ertugliflozin or the coadministered medications. Coadministration of rifampin 
      decreased ertugliflozin AUC and C(max) by 39% and 15%, respectively, and is not 
      expected to affect efficacy in a clinically meaningful manner. This comprehensive 
      evaluation supports administration to patients with T2DM without regard to 
      prandial status and with no dose adjustments for coadministration with commonly 
      prescribed drugs, or in patients with renal impairment or mild-to-moderate 
      hepatic impairment based on ertugliflozin PK.

TI  - Management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the elderly: special considerations.
PG  - 31-44
AB  - The principles of managing type 2 diabetes mellitus in the elderly are no 
      different from those in younger patients, but the priorities and therapeutic 
      strategies need to be cautiously individualised. The objectives of treatment are 
      to improve glycaemic control in a stepwise approach that involves 
      nonpharmacological methods including diet and exercise, and pharmacological 
      therapy including mixtures of oral antihyperglycaemic agents alone or in 
      combination with insulin. Although the goals of treatment may be the same for 
      elderly and younger patients, certain aspects of type 2 diabetes in the elderly 
      require special consideration. Treatment decisions are influenced by age and life 
      expectancy, comorbid conditions and severity of the vascular complications. 
      Adherence to dietary therapy, physical activity, and medication regimens may be 
      compromised by comorbid conditions and psychosocial limitations. Drug-induced 
      hypoglycaemia has been the main consideration and the most serious potential 
      complication. In addition, the long term macrovascular and microvascular 
      complications of type 2 diabetes are a source of significant morbidity and 
      mortality. Indeed, vascular and neuropathic complications are already present at 
      the time of diagnosis in a significant number of patients, and the impact of 
      improved diabetes control depends on the age and life expectancy of the patient. 
      Age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and the potential for adverse effects and 
      drug interactions should also be considered when choosing appropriate 
      pharmacological therapy. In general, a conservative and stepwise approach to the 
      treatment of the elderly patient with type 2 diabetes is suggested; treatment may 
      be initiated with monotherapy, followed by early intervention with a combination 
      of oral agents including a sulphonylurea as a foundation insulin secretagogue in 
      addition to a supplemental insulin sensitiser. Insulin therapy is eventually 
      required if significant hyperglycaemia [glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) >8%] 
      persists despite oral combination therapy. Combination therapy with evening 
      insulin and a long-acting sulphonylurea such as glimepiride is an effective 
      strategy to improve hyperglycaemia in the elderly patient with type 2 diabetes in 
      whom polypharmacy with oral agents is unsuccessful. In addition, such a regimen 
      is simple to follow for the patient who may not be able to adhere to a more 
      complicated insulin regimen. Hyperglycaemia in the elderly can be managed well 
      with practical intervention and a straightforward treatment plan to enhance 
      compliance. Optimal glycaemic control should be possible for every patient if 
      treatment is individualised; however, strict glycaemic control may not be 
      achievable in all patients or even desirable in many elderly patients.

TI  - Liraglutide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes: a clinical update.
PG  - 178-88
LID - 10.1097/MJT.0b013e3182204c16 [doi]
AB  - This review updates the pharmacology, efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
      liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analog approved for the treatment 
      of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in January 2010. MEDLINE was searched (May 2009-January 
      1, 2011) for articles in English, using the terms liraglutide, NN2211, incretin 
      mimetic, glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1, and GLP-1 receptor agonist. Abstracts 
      from key meetings (ADA 2009 and 2010, AACE 2010, EASD 2009, and EASD 2010) were 
      also searched for relevant data. A GLP-1 analog with pharmacokinetic properties 
      allowing once-daily administration via subcutaneous injection, liraglutide has 
      shown clinical benefits when used as monotherapy or in combination. Liraglutide 
      monotherapy has demonstrated efficacy in reducing hemoglobin A1c (A1C) and body 
      weight, with low risk for hypoglycemic events. Liraglutide has also been studied 
      in combination with metformin, glimepiride, and rosiglitazone for the treatment 
      of T2DM. Extension studies within the Liraglutide Effects and Action in Diabetes 
      clinical program have demonstrated the efficacy of liraglutide over 2 years of 
      treatment. Overall, liraglutide has been shown to be well tolerated, with 
      dose-dependent nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea being the most commonly reported 
      adverse events in clinical trials. Extended dosing periods have demonstrated the 
      durability of response of liraglutide with respect to glycemic control, lack of 
      weight gain, and blood pressure benefits. Compared with exenatide and 
      sitagliptin, liraglutide seems to offer greater improvements in A1C, fasting 
      plasma glucose, and body weight. Adverse events commonly associated with 
      liraglutide in clinical trials included nausea and hypoglycemia. Emerging data 
      suggest that liraglutide may be a useful option for patients with T2DM.

AB  - Glimepiride (GLI) is prescribed for the management of type-2 diabetes where as 
      pitavastatin (PIT) for the treatment of diabetes associated dyslipidemia. Both 
      the drugs are metabolized by CYP2C9 and have the potential of altering the enzyme 
      through either inhibition or induction. In this respect, we present a simple, 
      fast and validated bioanalytical LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous estimation 
      of GLI and PIT from rat plasma. Waters XTerra RP HPLC column (4.6×100mm, 5μm) 
      with mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 10mM ammonium acetate (pH-6.0) 
      in the ratio 85:15 (v/v) at a flow rate of 1mL/min was used for the 
      chromatographic separation. The negative ionization mode with MRM transitions: 
      m/z 420.17→288.13 for PIT, m/z 489.59→350.12 for GLI and m/z 380.08→316.31for 
      celecoxib as internal standard (IS). A total run time of 3min and LLOQ was found 
      to be 5ng/mL for both PIT and GLI. The method was applied to study the drug 
      interaction between GLI and PIT in rat liver microsomes. In vivo rat 
      pharmacokinetics study showed there was a 1.29-fold increase in AUC(0-∞) and 
      1.2-fold decrease in the clearance of PIT in presence of GLI. No notable 
      difference in the pharmacokinetic profile of GLI was observed upon the 
      intravenous co-administration of PIT.

TI  - [Glimepiride--an oral antidiabetic agent].
PG  - 125-7
AB  - Glimepiride is the oral antidiabetic, second-generation sulfonylurea. It is 
      structurally similar to glyburide. Glimepiride exhibited more potent 
      glucose-lowering effects than glyburide and longer duration of hypoglycemic 
      effect. Glimepiride is useful in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent (type II) 
      diabetes mellitus. Glimepiride is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise 
      for non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Glimepiride reduces glucose levels 
      blood by stimulating insulin release from functional pancreatic beta cells in 
      response to glucose. Glimepiride in daily dose 1 to 8 mg is causing a 
      dose-related decrease blood glucose levels and glycosylated hemoglobin fasting 
      state and postprandially. If the maximum dose of glimepiride fails to lower blood 
      glucose sufficiently, metformine or insuline may be added to glimepiride 
      monotherapy. Glimepiride is very safe drug and adverse effects causing by 
      glimepiride are very rare. The risk of hypoglycemia after use of glimepiride is 
      very small, therefore is the therapy with glimepiride is more preferable than the 
      therapy with glibenclamide.

TI  - New trends in the development of oral antidiabetic drugs.
PG  - 53-71
AB  - A large number of oral antidiabetic agents are available today. This article 
      provides a short review of the pharmacology and some clinical aspects of various 
      oral antidiabetic drugs. It focuses mainly on the newest developing drugs 
      (therapy of the near future) and on the most commonly used older groups for the 
      common approach of every-day practice (sulphonylureas). The primary goal of this 
      review is to compare the electrophysiological effects of glibenclamide in 
      isolated normal and streptozotocin induced diabetic rats and alloxan induced 
      rabbits ventricular preparations, while on the other hand to differentiate the 
      hypoglycaemic sulphonylureas (0.1-1000 mmol/kg) according to their cardiovascular 
      activity in healthy and diabetic animals. In vitro (1-100 micromol/l) as well as 
      chronically treated (5 mg/kg for 10 weeks) glibenclamide prolonged the action 
      potential duration in normal but failed to affect it in diabetic ventricular 
      preparations. Our results suggest that the sensitivity to glibenclamide of K(ATP) 
      channels in diabetic ventricular fibers is drastically decreased. The effects of 
      different sulphonylureas (tolbutamide, glibenclamide, gliclazide, glimepiride) on 
      ventricular ectopic beats as well as the duration of ventricular fibrillation 
      induced by 10 min ischemia/50 min reperfusion in healthy and diabetic rats were 
      compared. Tolbutamide and gliclazide dose-dependently enhanced both parameters 
      both in healthy and diabetic groups. Glibenclamide in healthy rats increased, 
      while in diabetic rats it decreased the arrhythmogenicity. Glimepiride depressed 
      the arrhythmogenicity in both healthy and diabetic animals. Glimepiride proved to 
      dose-dependently enhance the myocardial tissue flow in dog in contrast to 
      glibenclamide. These results confirm that glimepiride has less cardiovascular 
      actions than other sulphonylureas. From the newest oral antidiabetics this review 
      tries to emphasize the most important basic pharmacological properties, mechanism 
      of action, therapeutic use.

TI  - Oral hypoglycemic agents: insulin secretagogues, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and 
      insulin sensitizers.
PG  - S265-87
AB  - In this review we present the agents that are in use in the treatment of type 2 
      diabetes. Sulfonylureas of the 1st and 2nd generation increase insulin secretion 
      but can induce hyperinsulinemia and sometimes prolonged hypoglycemia. Glimepiride 
      is a new 3rd generation sulfonylurea with some advantages over the other members 
      of this group, such as a lower risk of hypoglycemia, no interaction with 
      cardiovascular KATP-channels and a possibility that it may increase insulin 
      sensitivity. There are also newer insulin secretagogues (such as neteglinide and 
      repaglinide) with a rapid onset of action on the beta-cell, therefore inducing a 
      more physiological profile of insulin secretion during meals. The category of 
      insulin sensitizers includes metformin and thiazolidinediones. Metformin 
      effectively reduces hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and macroangiopathy in patients 
      with type 2 diabetes. This agent increases the sensitivity of the liver and 
      peripheral tissues to insulin and, therefore, it could be considered as a drug of 
      choice for the prevention of type 2 diabetes. Thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone 
      and pioglitazone) increase the sensitivity of the tissues to insulin. This 
      mechanism of action makes them powerful therapeutic tools for the treatment of 
      type 2 diabetes (and possibly other insulin resistant states) either alone or in 
      combination with other oral agents. The category of agents that interfere with 
      the absorption of glucose and lipids includes alpha-glucosidase inhibitors 
      (acarbose and miglitol) and lipase inhibitors (or-listat). alpha-Glucocidase 
      inhibitors improve the time relationship between plasma insulin and glucose 
      increases after a meal. Therefore, these agents may be used in the treatment of 
      patients with type 2 diabetes, either alone at a very early stage of this disease 
      (when insulin secretion is still adequate), or in combination with insulin 
      secretagogues. alpha-Glucosidase inhibition may also prove useful as a supplement 
      to insulin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The inhibitor of 
      gastrointestinal lipase orlistat may prove a useful adjunct to hypocaloric diets 
      in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity.

TI  - Dapagliflozin: a review of its use in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 2289-312
LID - 10.2165/11209910-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - Dapagliflozin (Forxiga®) is the first in a novel class of glucose-lowering agents 
      known as sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and is used in the 
      treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. By inhibiting the transporter protein 
      SGLT2 in the kidneys, dapagliflozin reduces renal glucose reabsorption, leading 
      to urinary glucose excretion and a reduction in blood glucose levels. Unlike oral 
      antidiabetic drugs from several other classes, the efficacy of dapagliflozin is 
      independent of insulin secretion and action. Therefore, when used in combination 
      with other antidiabetic drugs, dapagliflozin provides complementary therapy via 
      its unique mechanism of action. A consistent finding across phase III, 
      randomized, double-blind trials in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 
      diabetes was that dapagliflozin 5 or 10 mg/day for 24 weeks as monotherapy in 
      previously untreated patients, or as add-on combination therapy with metformin, 
      glimepiride, pioglitazone or insulin-based therapy, significantly reduced both 
      glycosylated haemoglobin values (primary endpoint) and fasting plasma glucose 
      levels compared with placebo. Various randomized trials have also shown 
      improvements in postprandial blood glucose with dapagliflozin monotherapy and 
      combination therapy compared with placebo. In addition, dapagliflozin was 
      noninferior to glipizide, in terms of glycaemic control after 52 weeks, when used 
      as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes that was inadequately 
      controlled with metformin. In most clinical trials, dapagliflozin was associated 
      with reductions in body weight that were statistically superior to placebo or 
      active comparators. Longer-term extension studies indicate that the efficacy of 
      dapagliflozin is maintained for up to ≈2 years. Dapagliflozin was generally well 
      tolerated in clinical trials of 24 or 52 weeks duration and in extension studies 
      of up to ≈2 years. Events suggestive of genital infections and urinary tract 
      infections occurred more frequently among dapagliflozin than placebo recipients. 
      These adverse events are of special interest because they appear to be related to 
      the mechanism of action of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin has a low propensity to 
      cause hypoglycaemia, especially when used alone or in combination with metformin, 
      although the incidence of hypoglycaemic events reported with dapagliflozin in 
      clinical trials varied depending on the background therapy. Longer-term 
      tolerability/safety data with dapagliflozin are awaited with interest. In 
      conclusion, dapagliflozin, with its unique and complementary mechanism of action, 
      appears to be an important addition to the therapeutic options for the management 
      of type 2 diabetes, particularly when used as add-on therapy.

TI  - Dapagliflozin: a new sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor for treatment of 
      type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 361-72
LID - 10.2146/ajhp140168 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The pharmacologic properties and clinical efficacy of dapagliflozin, a 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 
      diabetes, are reviewed. SUMMARY: Dapagliflozin (Farxiga, AstraZeneca) is a 
      selective SGLT2 inhibitor approved as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve 
      glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. Dapagliflozin lowers blood 
      glucose independent of insulin secretion and action by inhibiting renal 
      reabsorption of glucose, thus promoting increased urinary excretion of glucose. 
      Dapagliflozin has been shown to improve glycemic parameters in patients with type 
      2 diabetes when used as monotherapy or in combination with metformin, 
      glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, or insulin. Dapagliflozin treatment is 
      associated with weight reduction, it has a low intrinsic propensity to cause 
      hypoglycemia, and it may offer the advantage of a complementary mechanism of 
      action when added to other therapies. During Phase III clinical trials, 
      dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated, with an overall frequency of adverse 
      events similar to that reported with placebo use. However, increased rates of 
      genital and, in some trials, urinary tract infections have been reported in 
      dapagliflozin-treated groups relative to placebo groups. Pooled data from 
      clinical trials indicated an imbalance in bladder cancer cases between 
      dapagliflozin-treated and placebo groups; however, most cases were diagnosed 
      within one year of exposure. Ongoing research is expected to further delineate 
      the effects of dapagliflozin on bladder cancer risk and cardiovascular safety 
      measures. CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, offers a novel treatment 
      option for type 2 diabetes that is independent of insulin secretion or action.

AB  - AIMS: To review the efficacy and safety of liraglutide from the phase 3 trials, 
      focusing primarily on glycaemic control. KEY FINDINGS: Liraglutide was shown to 
      reduce glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c) ) levels by up to 1.5% from baseline, 
      significantly more than the comparators sitagliptin (-0.9%), glimepiride (-0.5%), 
      rosiglitazone (-0.4%), insulin glargine (-1.1%) and exenatide (-0.8%). Both 
      fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) levels were 
      shown to be significantly reduced from baseline [up to -2.4 mmol/l (-43.2 mg/dl) 
      and -2.7 mmol/l (-48.6 mg/dl) for FPG and PPG in the liraglutide 1.8 mg group, 
      respectively]. Changes in HbA(1c) , FPG and PPG levels were sustained for the 
      duration of the studies (up to 52 weeks). The glycaemic control offered by 
      liraglutide was not associated with an increased rate of minor hypoglycaemic 
      events compared with comparator treatments, with rates significantly lower than 
      those of glimepiride and exenatide. Major hypoglycaemic events were rare and only 
      occurred in combination with a sulfonylurea. Nausea was the most frequent adverse 
      event, but subsided within the first few weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Liraglutide has been 
      shown to offer effective glycaemic control for patients with type 2 diabetes and 
      is appropriate for use across the conventional continuum of care. Despite the 
      sustained reductions in HbA(1c) , FPG and PPG levels achieved with liraglutide, 
      rates of minor hypoglycaemia were generally low, although the risk increased when 
      combined with a sulfonylurea. Liraglutide is therefore a promising new option for 
      the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Effects of glimepiride on in vivo insulin action in normal and diabetic rats.
PG  - 3-9
AB  - To evaluate the effects of glimepiride on insulin action in peripheral tissues, 
      we investigated insulin-induced glucose uptake in normal and diabetic rats using 
      the euglycemic clamp procedure (insulin infusion rates: 6 and 30 mU/kg/min). 
      Normal rats: After oral administration of glimepiride (0.1 mg/kg/day; NG) or 
      saline (NC) for 2 weeks, euglycemic clamp procedures were performed. During 
      submaximal hyperinsulinemia (620 +/- 35 pmol/l, mean +/- S.E.M.), metabolic 
      clearance rates of glucose (MCR) in NG were significantly higher than in NC (25.1 
      +/- 2.1 vs. 18.3 +/- 1.2 ml/kg/min, P < 0.05). During maximal hyperinsulinemia 
      (5235 +/- 270 pmol/l), MCRs in NG were higher than in NC, but there was no 
      statistical significance (43.3 +/- 2.8 and 38.9 +/- 2.8). Diabetic rats: 
      streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were divided into four groups, GI 
      (glimepiride treatment, 0.1 mg/kg/day p.o., with insulin, 5 U/day s.c.), SI 
      (insulin alone), SG (glimepiride alone), and SC (saline). MCRs in the four groups 
      were similar during 6 mU/kg/min clamps. During 30 mU/kg/min clamps, MCRs in GI 
      were significantly higher than those in SC, SG or SI (23.4 +/- 2.8 vs. 12.2 +/- 
      1.9 and 8.9 +/- 0.8, P < 0.01, and vs. 17.4 +/- 1.5, P < 0.05). Although MCRs in 
      SI tended to be higher than in SC, there was no significant statistical 
      difference between these two groups. These results suggest that glimepiride 
      enhances insulin action in peripheral tissues, and that glimepiride treatment 
      with insulin improves the insulin resistance observed in streptozotocin-induced 
      diabetic rats.

      perspective.
PG  - 1659-71
LID - 10.1002/jps.23085 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes results when insulin secretion is unable to keep the plasma 
      glucose levels as per acceptable range. This leads to chronic hyperglycemia and 
      its associated microvascular complications such as renal impairment (diabetic 
      nephropathy), retinal abnormalities (diabetic retinopathy), and autonomic, 
      sensory, and motor neuropathies (diabetic neuropathy) and macrovascular disease. 
      Historically, type 2 diabetes is well known as an adult-onset disease; however, 
      lately, the incidence of the disease is reported to be increasing in children. 
      Despite the wealth of information concerning type 2 diabetes in adults, data 
      unique to the pediatric age group regarding the pathophysiology and therapy for 
      type 2 diabetes are limited. For treatment in pediatric type 2 diabetes, 
      metformin and insulin are the only antidiabetic agents approved currently. There 
      are data of use of other oral antidiabetic drugs including glimepiride, 
      rosiglitazone, and glyburide (in combination with metformin) in pediatric 
      patients; however, formal clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy 
      have not been conducted. This review will compare the clinical pharmacology 
      aspects of the oral type 2 diabetic drugs in pediatric and adult populations in 
      order to determine any differences between the two patient groups.

TI  - Hypoglycemia possibly caused by CYP2C9-mediated drug interaction in combination 
      with bucolome: a case report.
PG  - 39
LID - 10.1186/s40780-021-00221-y [doi]
LID - 39
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bucolome is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and uricosuric 
      agent, currently used only in Japan. It is known to induce drug interactions by 
      inhibiting cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9. It is often used to enhance the 
      anticoagulant effect of warfarin by utilizing its drug interactions. There are 
      only a few reports on drug interactions of bucolome and the mechanism remain 
      poorly understood. CASE PRESENTATION: An 81-year-old woman with a history of type 
      2 diabetes mellitus was taking glimepiride 2 mg/day and voglibose 0.6 mg/day. 
      After hospitalization, the patient underwent surgical aortic valve replacement 
      surgery (day 0). Glimepiride and voglibose were resumed on the second 
      postoperative day (day 2), and warfarin was started to prevent thromboembolism. 
      Since the prothrombin time-international normalized ratio on day 9 was low at 
      1.24, 300 mg/day of bucolome was added to enhance the effect of warfarin. A 
      gradual decrease in blood glucose levels was observed from the day after bucolome 
      administration was initiated. Hypoglycemia in the 56-57 mg/dL range occurred 
      before lunch and dinner on the 6th day (day 14) of bucolome administration, due 
      to which voglibose was discontinued. Hypoglycemia below 70 mg/dL was not observed 
      thereafter, and the general condition of the patient was stable. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Based on the clinical course and literature review, we believe that hypoglycemia 
      in the present case was due to a drug interaction, caused by inhibition of CYP2C9 
      by bucolome and competitive inhibition of CYP2C9 by warfarin, which affected the 
      pharmacokinetics of glimepiride. The possibility of hypoglycemia due to drug 
      interactions should be considered by physicians, when bucolome is included to 
      enhance the effect of warfarin, in patients taking glimepiride.

      M2). There were no statistically significant differences between mean serum 
      pharmacokinetic parameters for the oral and intravenous formulations either with 
      glimepiride or M1. Mean urinary recovery of M1 plus M2 was 50% of the dose for 
      the glimepiride tablet and 51% for the intravenous injection. The absolute 
      bioavailability of the tablet formulation was 107% (AUDC(glimepiride)), 109% 
      (AUDC(M1)) and 97% (urinary recovery). The tablet formulation of glimepiride is 
      completely bioavailable and was safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to develop a population pharmacokinetic 
      (PPK) model of glimepiride and to investigate the influence of genetic 
      polymorphisms in CYP2C9 on the PPK of glimepiride in healthy Korean subjects. 
      METHODS: Serum data after a single oral dose of 2 mg of glimepiride in 177 
      healthy male Korean subjects (CYP2C9*1*1: 163 subjects, *1/*3: 14 subjects) were 
      used. We estimated the PPK of glimepiride using a nonlinear mixed effects 
      modeling (NONMEM) method and explored the possible influence of genetic 
      polymorphisms in CYP2C9 on the PPK of glimepiride. RESULTS: The disposition of 
      glimepiride was best described with a two-compartment model with a Weibull-type 
      absorption and first-order elimination. The visual predictive check indicated 
      that the pharmacokinetic profile of glimepiride was adequately described by the 
      proposed PPK model. The CYP2C9 genotypes as covariate significantly (P < 0.001) 
      influenced the apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of glimepiride. The estimated CL/F 
      of glimepiride was higher (1.60-fold) in CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects than in CYP2C9*1/*3 
      subjects. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C9 
      influence the substantial interindividual variability in the disposition of 
      glimepiride, and these polymorphisms may affect the clinical response to 
      glimepiride therapy.

TI  - Transdermal glimepiride delivery system based on optimized ethosomal 
      nano-vesicles: Preparation, characterization, in vitro, ex vivo and clinical 
      evaluation.

AB  - This work aimed to develop an optimized ethosomal formulation of glimepiride then 
      loading into transdermal films to offer lower drug side effect, extended release 
      behavior and avoid first pass effect. Four formulation factors were optimized for 
      their effects on vesicle size (Y1), entrapment efficiency (Y2) and vesicle 
      flexibility (Y3). Optimum desirability was identified and, an optimized 
      formulation was prepared, characterized and loaded into transdermal films. 
      Ex-vivo permeation study for the prepared films was conducted and, the permeation 
      parameters and drug permeation mechanism were identified. Penetration through rat 
      skin was studied using confocal laser microscope. In-vivo study was performed 
      following transdermal application on human volunteers. The percent of alcohol was 
      significantly affecting all the studied responses while the other factors and 
      their interaction effects were varied on their effects on each response. The 
      optimized ethosomal formulation showed observed values for Y1, Y2 and Y3 of 61 
      nm, 97.12% and 54.03, respectively. Ex-vivo permeation of films loaded with 
      optimized ethosomal formulation was superior to that of the corresponding pure 
      drug transdermal films and this finding was also confirmed after confocal laser 
      microscope study. Permeation of glimepiride from the prepared films was in favor 
      of Higushi-diffusion model and exhibited non-Fickian or anomalous release 
      mechanism. In-vivo study revealed extended drug release behavior and lower 
      maximum drug plasma level from transdermal films loaded with drug ethosomal 
      formulation. So, the ethosomal formulation could be considered a suitable drug 
      delivery system especially when loaded into transdermal vehicle with possible 
      reduction in side effects and controlling the drug release.

TI  - A rapid and highly sensitive method for the determination of glimepiride in human 
      plasma by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry: 
      application to a pre-clinical pharmacokinetic study.
PG  - 58-63
AB  - A sensitive and specific liquid chromatography-positive electrospray 
      ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method has been developed and validated for 
      the determination of glimepiride (GPD) in human plasma. GPD and the internal 
      standard (IS, glibenclamide) were extracted from a small aliquot of human plasma 
      (200 microL) by a simple liquid-liquid extraction technique using ethyl acetate 
      as extraction solvent. The compounds were separated on a YMC Propack, C18, 4.6x50 
      mm column using a mixture of ammonium acetate buffer, acetonitrile and methanol 
      (30:60:10, v/v) as mobile phase at 0.5 mL/min on an API 4000 Sciex mass 
      spectrometer connected to an Agilent HPLC system. Method validation and 
      pre-clinical sample analysis was performed as per FDA guidelines and the results 
      met the acceptance criteria. GPD and IS were detected without any interference 
      from human plasma matrix. The method was proved to be accurate and precise at 
      linearity range of 0.02-100.00 ng/mL with a correlation coefficient of 0.999. The 
      method was robust with a lower limit of quantitation of 0.02 ng/mL. Intra- and 
      inter-day accuracies for GPD were 88.60-113.50 and 96.82-103.93%, respectively. 
      The inter-day precision was better than 12.21%. This method enabled faster and 
      reliable determination of GPD in a pre-clinical study.

TI  - Dose linearity assessment of glimepiride (Amaryl) tablets in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 341-57
AB  - Twelve healthy fasting male volunteers received glimepiride in 1, 2, 4 or 8 mg 
      single oral doses. On the days when glimepiride was taken, the subjects were 
      given a standardised carbohydrate diet (18 bread exchange units) and drank 125 ml 
      of water hourly. Blood and urine samples were taken before drug administration 
      and afterwards for up to 36 hours (blood) and 48 hours (urine) to determine serum 
      and urinary concentrations of glimepiride and its hydroxy- and 
      carboxy-metabolites (M1 and M2). The areas under the curve for glimepiride after 
      oral doses of 1 to 8 mg and the urinary recovery of its metabolites M1 and M2 
      were dose linear. All confidence intervals were well contained within the 
      bioequivalence range of 80-125%. There was a statistically significant difference 
      for Cmax values of glimepiride between doses after dose normalisation. A 
      dose-dependent increase for Cmax was nevertheless clearly observed with a 
      correlation coefficient of r=0.90. The pharmacokinetics of glimepiride are dose 
      linear in the dose range 1 to 8 mg, and glimepiride was safe and well tolerated 
      in healthy volunteers.

TI  - Lack of pharmacokinetic interaction between dapagliflozin, a novel sodium-glucose 
      transporter 2 inhibitor, and metformin, pioglitazone, glimepiride or sitagliptin 
      in healthy subjects.
PG  - 47-54
LID - 10.1111/j.1463-1326.2010.01314.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Dapagliflozin increases urinary glucose excretion by selectively inhibiting 
      renal sodium-glucose transporter 2, an insulin-independent mechanism of action 
      that may be complementary to that of other oral antidiabetes drugs. The current 
      studies assessed the potential for pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between 
      dapagliflozin and pioglitazone, metformin, glimepiride or sitagliptin in healthy 
      subjects following single-dose administration. METHODS: In open-label, 
      randomized, three-period, three-treatment crossover studies, 24 subjects received 
      50 mg dapagliflozin, 45 mg pioglitazone or the combination, while 18 subjects 
      received 20 mg dapagliflozin, 1000 mg metformin or the combination. In an 
      open-label, randomized, five-period, five-treatment, unbalanced crossover study, 
      18 subjects first received 20 mg dapagliflozin, 4 mg glimepiride or the 
      combination, and afterward 100 mg sitagliptin or sitagliptin plus 20 mg 
      dapagliflozin. Blood samples were taken over 72 h of each treatment period. Lack 
      of PK interaction was defined as the ratio of geometric means and 90% confidence 
      interval (CI) for combination:monotherapy being within the range of 0.80-1.25. 
      RESULTS: Co-administration of dapagliflozin with pioglitazone, metformin, 
      glimepiride or sitagliptin had no effect on dapagliflozin maximum plasma 
      concentration (C(max) ) or area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). 
      Similarly, dapagliflozin did not affect the C(max) or AUC for the co-administered 
      drug, except for slight extensions of the 90% CI for the ratio of geometric means 
      for glimepiride AUC (upper limit 1.29) and pioglitazone C(max) (lower limit 
      0.75). All monotherapies and combination therapies were well tolerated. 
      CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin can be co-administered with pioglitazone, metformin, 
      glimepiride or sitagliptin without dose adjustment of either drug.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study aims at applying pharmaceutical nanotechnology and 
      D-optimal fractional factorial design to screen and optimize the high-risk 
      variables affecting the performance of a complex drug delivery system consisting 
      of glimepiride-Zein nanoparticles and inclusion of the optimized formula with 
      thermoresponsive triblock copolymers in in situ gel. METHODS: Sixteen 
      nanoparticle formulations were prepared by liquid-liquid phase separation method 
      according to the D-optimal fractional factorial design encompassing five 
      variables at two levels. The responses investigated were glimepiride entrapment 
      capacity (EC), particle size and size distribution, zeta potential, and in vitro 
      drug release from the prepared nanoparticles. Furthermore, the feasibility of 
      embedding the optimized Zein-based glimepiride nanoparticles within 
      thermoresponsive triblock copolymers 
      poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-block-poly(ethylene 
      glycol)-block-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) in in situ gel was evaluated for 
      controlling glimepiride release rate. RESULTS: Through the systematic 
      optimization phase, improvement of glimepiride EC of 33.6%, nanoparticle size of 
      120.9 nm with a skewness value of 0.2, zeta potential of 11.1 mV, and sustained 
      release features of 3.3% and 17.3% drug released after 2 and 24 hours, 
      respectively, were obtained. These desirability functions were obtained at Zein 
      and glimepiride loadings of 50 and 75 mg, respectively, utilizing 
      didodecyldimethylammonium bromide as a stabilizer at 0.1% and 90% ethanol as a 
      common solvent. Moreover, incorporating this optimized formulation in triblock 
      copolymers-based in situ gel demonstrated pseudoplastic behavior with reduction 
      of drug release rate as the concentration of polymer increased. CONCLUSION: This 
      approach to control the release of glimepiride using Zein nanoparticles/triblock 
      copolymers-based in situ gel forming intramuscular implants could be useful for 
      improving diabetes treatment effectiveness.

TI  - Biopharmaceutical characterization of oral immediate release drug products. In 
      vitro/in vivo comparison of phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium, glimepiride and 
      levofloxacin.
PG  - 305-11
AB  - The development of in vitro dissolution tests using the paddle and basket 
      apparatus is described with respect to the qualification/validation of the 
      testing procedure. Three examples of immediate release products containing 
      phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium, glimepiride, and levofloxacin providing 
      different solubility characteristics are evaluated. The solubility was high in 
      the case of phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium and levofloxacin and low for 
      glimepiride according to the biopharmaceutics classification system. The 
      permeability is studied using the human colorectal carcinoma cell line CaCo-2. 
      The permeability (10(-6) cm/s) of phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium, glimepiride, 
      and levofloxacin was high. The determined permeability data are confirmed by 
      absorption data obtained by means of numerical deconvolution of plasma 
      concentrations. Recommendations are given for the biopharmaceutical 
      characterization of the three immediate release drug products, taking into 
      account in vitro and in vivo comparison as well as the biopharmaceutics drug 
      classification system. The evaluated acceptance criteria are the following: 
      phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium (80% in 30 min), glimepiride (80% in 15 min) 
      and levofloxacin (80% in 30 min). Typically, for immediate release formulations, 
      one limit is specified for the dissolution to ensure the release of the active 
      ingredient within the present time period. Since phenoxymethylpenicillin 
      potassium and levofloxacin belong to Case 1, no in vitro/in vivo correlation is 
      expected, absorption may be gastric emptying dependent. Glimepiride is 
      categorized to Case 2. Nevertheless, a correlation with the in vivo dissolution 
      profile does not exist, because of the pH-dependent low solubility of the drug. 
      Finally, recommendations are made for the batch control of drug products in 
      accordance with the four Cases.

      microemulsion technique.
PG  - 3777-88
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S105419 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this work was to prepare an oil/water glimepiride (GM) 
      microemulsion (ME) for oral administration to improve its solubility and enhance 
      its bioavailability. Based on a solubility study, pseudoternary phase diagrams, 
      and Box-Behnken design, the oil/water GMME formulation was optimized and 
      prepared. GMME was characterized by dynamic laser light scattering, zeta 
      potential, transmission electron microscopy, and viscosity. The in vitro drug 
      release, storage stability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of GMME were 
      investigated. The optimized GMME was composed of Capryol 90 (oil), Cremophor RH40 
      (surfactant), and Transcutol (cosurfactant), and increased GM solubility up to 
      544.6±4.91 µg/mL. The GMME was spherical in shape. The particle size and its 
      polydispersity index were 38.9±17.46 nm and 0.266±0.057, respectively. Meanwhile, 
      the GMME was physicochemically stable at 4°C for at least 3 months. The 
      short-term efficacy in diabetic mice provided the proof that blood glucose had a 
      consistent and significant reduction at a dose of 375 µg/kg whether via IP 
      injection or IG administration of GMME. Compared with the glimepiride suspensions 
      or glimepiride-meglumine complex solution, the pharmacokinetics of GMME in Wistar 
      rats via IG administration exhibited higher plasma drug concentration, larger 
      area under the curve, and more enhanced oral bioavailability. There was a good 
      correlation of GMME between the in vitro release values and the in vivo oral 
      absorption. ME could be an effective oral drug delivery system to improve 
      bioavailability of GM.

TI  - The mechanisms underlying the unique pharmacodynamics of nateglinide.
PG  - M37-43
AB  - Nateglinide, a D-phenylalanine derivative, belongs to a new group of 
      insulinotropic agents with rapid onset and short duration of action. These agents 
      have been developed to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia associated with 
      pharmacological control and to decrease the likelihood of pancreatic beta-cell 
      exhaustion. Nateglinide mediates the release of insulin from beta-cells by 
      binding to the sulphonylurea receptors, which leads to the closure of 
      ATP-sensitive K(+) channels. Increasing evidence from receptor binding, 
      mechanistic and in vitro and in vivo insulin studies indicate unique 
      pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties with nateglinide that are distinct 
      from those of sulphonylureas. The time required by nateglinide to close beta-cell 
      K(ATP) channels is comparable to that of glyburide but threefold and fivefold 
      faster than repaglinide and glimepiride, respectively. Furthermore, its effects 
      are rapidly reversed with an off-rate at the K(ATP) channel twice as fast as that 
      of glyburide and glimepiride and five times faster than repaglinide. This results 
      in a rapid and short insulin response characteristic of the physiological pattern 
      of post-mealtime insulin release. Internalisation into beta-cells is not required 
      for the action of nateglinide. Given that the kinetic profile of the agent is 
      associated with selective enhancement of early-phase insulin secretion, 
      nateglinide is expected to minimise post-meal hyperglycaemia with minimal 
      propensity for hypoglycaemia.

TI  - [Preparation and evaluation in vivo and in vitro of glimepiride gel-matrix 
      controlled-release patch].
PG  - 640-4
AB  - AIM: To study the pharmaceutical characterization, the pharmacokinetics and 
      relative bioavailability of glimepiride gel-matrix controlled-release patch in 
      rats. METHODS: An HPLC method was established for the determination of 
      glimepiride in the permeation receptor and patch. The permeation rate and 
      penetration mechanism of glimepiride-TDDS through rabbit skin in vitro was 
      examined. The determination of drug content and the examination of weight 
      difference and stability of the glimepiride-TDDS were carried out. Another HPLC 
      method after pre-column derivatization was developed to determine the glimepiride 
      serum concentration and then employed to study the pharmacokinetics and relative 
      bioavailability of glimepiride after a single dose of oral or patch 
      administration in rats. RESULTS: The permeation tests through excised rabbit skin 
      demonstrated that the optimized glimepiride controlled-release patch exhibited 
      zero-order kinetic characteristics that satisfied the demands of original design. 
      The determination of glimepiride content and the quality control of weight 
      difference of the patch accorded with Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of 
      China of 2000 edition and the pharmaceutical characterization showed good 
      stability. The HPLC method for the determination of serum glimepiride was shown 
      to be a sensitive and simple one. The pharmacokinetic results showed that TDDS 
      could decrease the maximum serum concentration, prolong the peak time, extend the 
      MRT by 5.5 times compared with oral administration and maintain the serum 
      concentration of glimepiride at a higher level even after 120 h of 
      administration. The relative bioavailability of glimepiride-TDDS was 20.3% versus 
      oral administration. CONCLUSION: The glimepiride-TDDS showed a slower, longer and 
      smoother serum concentration-time profile, as compared with conventional oral 
      administration in both absorption and elimination phase. As a result, it was 
      evident that the patch exhibited good controlled-release properties.

TI  - [Risk and benefit of sulfonylureas--their role in view of new treatment options 
      for type 2 diabetes].
PG  - 65-72; quiz 73-4
AB  - Currently, the therapy with oral antidiabetic drugs undergoes major changes. The 
      use of sulfonylureas is in marked decline. The major argument in favor of newer 
      oral antidiabetic drugs is the lower risk of hypoglycemia. At the present time 
      however, it is unclear whether DDP4 inhibitors or SGLT2 inhibitors lead to better 
      outcomes with respect to cardiovascular events and overall mortality. Most 
      evidence on the therapeutic use of sulfonylureas has been gained with 
      glibenclamide and to some degree sulfonylureas and glibenclamide have become 
      synonymous. Since sulfonylureas vary considerably in their affinity for the 
      K(ATP) channel subtypes and in their pharmacokinetic properties, the 
      epidemiological evidence that outcomes tend to be less favorable with 
      glibenclamide than with glimepiride or gliclazide has gained some attention. 
      Beyond debate is the efficacy of metformin to diminish cardiovascular events in 
      type 2 diabetes, probably due to effects beyond the lowering of blood glucose.

TI  - Improved liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric determination and 
      pharmacokinetic study of glimepiride in human plasma.
PG  - 394-401
AB  - An improved liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric method for the 
      determination of glimepiride in human plasma has been developed and fully 
      validated. The article describes in detail the bioanalytical procedure and 
      summarizes the validation results obtained. The samples were extracted using 
      liquid--liquid extraction with a mixture of 1-chlorobutane-isopropanol-ethyl 
      acetate (88:2:10, v/v/v). The chromatographic separation was performed on a 
      reversed-phase Hypersil ODScolumn (250 x 4.6 mm i.d.; 5 microm particle size) 
      using a mobile phase consisting of formic acid 0.05 M-acetonitrile (28:72, v/v), 
      pumped at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min(-1) heated to 25 degrees C. The analytes were 
      detected using an API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with positive 
      electrospray ionization in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Tandem mass 
      spectrometric detection enabled the quantitation of glimepiride down to 0.50 ng 
      mL(-1). Calibration graphs were linear (r better than 0.998, n=1), in 
      concentration range 0.50--1000 ng mL(-1), and the intra- and inter- day RSD 
      values were less than 10.37 and 11.55% for glimepiride. The method was 
      successfully applied to a kinetic study in order to assess the main 
      pharmacokinetic parameters of glimepiride.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic modeling of glimepiride plasma concentration in healthy subjects.
PG  - 949-53
AB  - AIM: To determine the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride, a sulfonylurea 
      antidiabetic agent, after single dose administration in healthy subjects. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pharmacokinetic data for modeling were extracted from a 
      single-center, randomized, single-dose, fasting state, two-way crossover 
      bioequivalence study on 4 mg glimepiride in 24 healthy subjects. RESULTS: Plasma 
      concentrations of glimepiride were measured using a validated LC/MS/MS method. 
      The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using non-compartmental analysis. 
      Different pharmacokinetic models were tested to evaluate pharmacokinetics of 
      glimepiride. The optimal model was chosen based on Akaike's Information Criteria. 
      CONCLUSION: Compartmental analysis demonstrated that oral glimepiride tablets 
      obey one compartment open model with rapid absorption following a first order 
      kinetics and a short half-life.

LID - 10.1002/jps.21631 [doi]
AB  - This study examined the physicochemical-pharmacokinetic relationships for the 
      sulphonylureas in the perfused rat pancreas and liver. Multiple indicator 
      dilution studies were conducted with bolus injections of tolbutamide, 
      chlorpropamide, gliclazide, glipizide, glibenclamide and glimepiride, and a 
      reference marker albumin, in the perfused pancreas and liver. Individual solute 
      pharmacokinetics were analysed using nonparametric moment analysis and nonlinear 
      regression assuming a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model. All solutes 
      had similar shaped outflow concentration-time profiles in both the pancreas and 
      liver, but varied in extraction. Negligible drug extraction was evident in the 
      pancreas. Hepatic extraction ranged from 0.03 (tolbutamide) to 0.52 
      (glibenclamide) and could be related to solute lipophilicity and perfusate 
      protein binding. The sulphonylurea mean transit times in both the pancreas and 
      liver varied four- and ninefold respectively and were related to the 
      lipophilicity and perfusate protein binding of the drug. The permeability surface 
      area product of sulphonylureas from the perfusate into the organs were greater in 
      the liver and were mainly determined by lipophilicity (pancreas, r2 = 0.89; 
      liver, r2 = 0.80). The distribution of the sulphonylureas in both the perfused 
      pancreas and perfused liver was dependent on their lipophilicity and perfusate 
      protein binding.

      comparison with other sulfonylureas and newer oral antihyperglycemic agents.

LID - S0168-8227(17)31985-X [pii]

AB  - The sulfonylureas are effective oral glucose-lowering agents with a long history 
      of clinical use. While all have the same general mechanism of action, their 
      pharmacokinetic properties are influenced by factors such as dosage, rate of 
      absorption, duration of action, route of elimination, tissue specificity, and 
      binding affinity for pancreatic β-cell receptor. The result is a class of agents 
      with similar HbA1c-lowering efficacy, but well-documented differences in terms of 
      effects on hypoglycemia, and cardiovascular and renal safety. This review 
      examines the differences between currently available sulfonylureas with a focus 
      on how gliclazide modified release (MR) differs from other members of this class 
      and from newer oral antihyperglycemic agents in the form of dipeptidyl 
      peptidase-4 (DPP4) and sodium- glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. The 
      first part focuses on major outcome trials that have been conducted with the 
      sulfonylureas and new oral agents. Consideration is then given to factors 
      important for day-to-day prescribing including efficacy and durability, weight 
      changes, hypoglycemia, renal effects and cost. Based on current evidence, 
      third-generation sulfonylureas such as gliclazide MR possess many of the 
      properties desired of a type 2 diabetes drug including high glucose-lowering 
      efficacy, once-daily oral administration, few side effects other than mild 
      hypoglycemia, and cardiovascular safety.

TI  - Vildagliptin: a review of its use in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 2089-112
LID - 10.2165/11206370-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - Vildagliptin (Galvus®, Jalra®, Xiliarx®) is an orally administered dipeptidyl 
      peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
      vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily is indicated for use in combination with metformin 
      or a thiazolidinedione, and vildagliptin 50 mg once daily is indicated for use in 
      combination with a sulfonylurea. A fixed-dose combination of 
      vildagliptin/metformin (Eucreas®, Icandra®, Zomarist®) is also available. This 
      article reviews the clinical efficacy and tolerability of vildagliptin in 
      patients with type 2 diabetes, as well as summarizing its pharmacological 
      properties. The efficacy of monotherapy or combination therapy with oral 
      vildagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes has been examined in randomized, 
      double-blind, multicentre trials. Monotherapy with vildagliptin 50 mg once or 
      twice daily reduced glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) from baseline to a 
      significantly greater extent than placebo, according to the results of 12- to 
      52-week trials in patients with type 2 diabetes. In terms of the reduction from 
      baseline in HbA(1c) seen in active comparator trials of 12-104 weeks' duration, 
      the noninferiority of vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily was established versus 
      acarbose or rosiglitazone, the noninferiority of vildagliptin 100 mg once daily 
      (an off-label dosage) versus metformin was established in elderly patients and 
      vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily was more effective than voglibose; however, the 
      noninferiority of vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily versus metformin or gliclazide 
      was not established in two other trials. Combination therapy with vildagliptin 
      50 mg twice daily plus metformin improved HbA(1c) to a significantly greater 
      extent than monotherapy with metformin and/or vildagliptin alone in patients with 
      type 2 diabetes whose disease was inadequately controlled by metformin 
      monotherapy or who were treatment naive, according to the results of 12- or 
      24-week trials. In addition, vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily plus metformin 
      demonstrated noninferiority to pioglitazone plus metformin, glimepiride plus 
      metformin or gliclazide plus metformin in terms of the change from baseline in 
      HbA(1c) after 24 or 52 weeks' therapy in patients with inadequately controlled 
      type 2 diabetes. The addition of vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily to pioglitazone 
      or vildagliptin 50 mg once daily to glimepiride improved HbA(1c) to a 
      significantly greater extent than a thiazolidinedione or glimepiride alone in 
      patients with type 2 diabetes whose disease was inadequately controlled, 
      according to the results of 24-week trials. Oral vildagliptin 50 mg once or twice 
      daily was generally well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes. In 
      particular, vildagliptin was associated with a low risk of hypoglycaemia and was 
      weight neutral. Increases in transaminase levels were sometimes observed with a 
      vildagliptin dosage of 100 mg once daily in clinical trials, and liver function 
      should be monitored in patients receiving vildagliptin. However, meta-analyses of 
      clinical trial data suggested that vildagliptin 50 mg once or twice daily was not 
      associated with an increased risk of hepatic adverse events, transaminase 
      elevations ≥3 × the upper limit of normal, pancreatitis, cardiovascular or 
      cerebrovascular events, infections or skin-related toxicity. In conclusion, 
      vildagliptin is an important option for use in combination with metformin, a 
      sulfonylurea or a thiazolidinedione in patients with type 2 diabetes who require 
      combination therapy.

TI  - Metabolic Interaction Potential between Clopidogrel and Sulfonylurea Antidiabetic 
      Agents: Effects on Clopidogrel Bioactivation.
PG  - 18-24
LID - 10.1159/000441230 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with diabetes have increased rates of cardiovascular events, 
      and concomitant use of antidiabetic agents and clopidogrel may increase the risk 
      for drug interactions. This study was undertaken to investigate the interaction 
      potential between sulfonylurea drugs and clopidogrel, with an emphasis on key 
      steps in the clopidogrel bioactivation processes. METHODS: Inhibition of 
      clopidogrel metabolism by sulfonylureas was evaluated by monitoring the formation 
      of clopidogrel carboxylic acid and 2-oxo-clopidogrel in human liver microsomes 
      (HLM), human intestinal microsomes and recombinant human enzymes. CYP2C9-based 
      interaction was investigated for both 2-oxo-clopidogrel and glimepiride using HLM 
      and the recombinant CYP2C9 system. RESULTS: For the formation of clopidogrel 
      carboxylic acid (the deactivation step) and 2-oxo-clopidogrel (the first step of 
      bioactivation) in human microsomes, the inhibition potency of the 3 sulfonylurea 
      drugs tested followed the order of glimepiride > glipizide > gliclazide. For the 
      metabolism of 2-oxo-clopidogrel (the second step of bioactivation), glimepiride 
      demonstrated a relatively strong inhibition against CYP2C9 activity (IC50 12.7 
      μmol/l). In addition, 2-oxo-clopidogrel displayed a moderate inhibitory effect 
      toward the CYP2C9-mediated metabolism of glimepiride. CONCLUSION: The moderate 
      inhibition observed for clopidogrel bioactivation may not present a significant 
      risk for drug-drug interactions between sulfonylureas and clopidogrel. While 
      these findings bode well for multidrug therapies involving sulfonylureas and 
      clopidogrel, clinical investigations are needed to define the clinical risk and 
      benefit for combining these agents for the management of cardiovascular events in 
      diabetic patients.

TI  - [Canagliflozin (Invokana): kidney SGLT2 cotransporter inhibitor for treating type 
      2 diabetes].
PG  - 692-9
AB  - Canagliflozin is an inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporters type 2 (SGLT2) 
      that are present in renal tubules. This specific insulin-independent mechanism 
      promotes glucosuria, which results in a reduction in fasting and postprandial 
      glycaemia and a decrease of glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)). Furthermore, 
      canagliflozin promotes weight loss and lowers arterial (mainly systolic) blood 
      pressure. Its efficacy is decreased in patients with renal insufficiency and the 
      treatment should be stopped if estimated glomerular filtration rate is below 45 
      ml/min/1.73 m2. Both the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin have been 
      investigated in 24 to 104-week controlled trials versus placebo or versus an 
      active comparator (glimepiride or sitagliptin). The mean reduction in HbA(1c) 
      averages 0.75% when added to other treatments, as compared to placebo. The 100 mg 
      dose is as active as sitagliptin 100 mg while the 300 mg canagliflozin dose is 
      even more efficacious. Adverse events are mostly mycotic genital infections and 
      more rarely mild urinary tract infections. Caution is required in elderly 
      patients and the risk of volume depletion should be checked (hypotension). 
      Hypoglycaemia may occur only in patients already treated with an 
      insulin-secreting agent or insulin. Canagliflozin is commercialized under the 
      trade name Invokana, at the doses of 100 mg and 300 mg once daily, for the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Bioequivalence evaluation of two brands of glimepiride 4 mg tablets in healthy 
      subjects.
PG  - 203-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper describes a bioequivalence study with two oral glimepiride 
      (4 mg) tablets formulations. The reference preparation was Solosa/Aventis 
      Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA, and the test preparation was Glimepiride/Specifar, 
      Athens, Greece. SUBJECTS, MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study design was open, 
      randomized, two-period, two-sequence, two-treatment with crossover involving 24 
      healthy male and female subjects. All subjects completed the study. Glimepiride 
      plasma concentrations were measured utilizing a sensitive, reproducible and 
      accurate HPLC method. Pharmacokinetic parameters used to assess bioequivalence 
      were AUC(0_last), AUC(0-inf) for the extent of absorption and Cmax and tmax for 
      the rate of absorption. Statistical evaluation of Cmax, AUC(0_last), and 
      AUC(0-inf) was done after semilogarithmic transformation using a two-way analysis 
      of variance (ANOVA). Tmax values were tested using the distribution-free 
      Hodges-Lehman interval. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The parametric 90% confidence 
      intervals for ratio T/R ranged from 90.60-108.00% (point estimate 98.90%) for 
      AUC(0-last), 90.70-107.90% (point estimate 98.90%) for AUC(0-inf) and 
      86.70-103.70% (point estimate 94.80%) for Cmax, respectively. Based on the 
      results of tmax, Kel and t(1/2), there were no statistically significant 
      differences and the two glimepiride preparations are equivalent with respect to 
      rate and extent of absorption as defined by the European Union bioequivalence 
      requirements.

TI  - Sex difference in pharmacokinetics of the novel sulfonylurea antidiabetic 
      glimepiride in rats.
PG  - 1317-21
AB  - Glimepiride (Hoe 490, CAS 93479-97-1), a novel sulfonylurea antidiabetic agent, 
      was studied for the cause of sex-related difference in the elimination clearance 
      of the unchanged drug in rats. After intravenous and oral administration, the 
      serum level of the unchanged drug was higher in female rats and AUC and t1/2 
      (beta) values were about 1.7- and 1.4-fold those for males, while Vss and oral 
      bioavailability were nearly equal. The excretion clearance of the unchanged drug 
      was quite small in both male and female animals, and most of the administered 
      drug was excreted into the bile as a hydroxymethyl derivative, M1. In the in 
      vitro metabolism study, M1 was found to be formed mainly in the liver microsomal 
      fraction, and its hydroxylation activity was significantly higher in males. This 
      metabolic activity was dependent on NADPH and was inhibited by proadifen. On the 
      other hand, formation of M2, a carboxyl derivative, from M1 was observed in the 
      cytosol fraction and showed no sex difference. Its metabolic activity depended on 
      NAD and was inhibited by pyrazole. These results suggest that the sex difference 
      observed in rat pharmacokinetics is mainly due to different hydroxylation 
      activities of the side chain methyl group based on the participation of sex 
      dependent cytochrome P-450 in liver microsomes.

LID - 10.1080/10837450.2018.1517366 [doi]
AB  - Glimepiride (Gmp) a third generation of sulphonylurea is a weakly acidic 
      hypoglycemic drug that belongs to Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) 
      class II. It suffers from poor solubility as well as erratic and variable 
      therapeutic effect. The authors investigated the feasibility of utilizing two 
      nontoxic and biodegradable biopolymers (casein (CA) and chitosan (CT)) as a new 
      in-situ gelling tablet matrix to circumvent this limitation. Both polymers in 
      different ratios were combined with constant dose of the drug and compressed by 
      direct compression to produce constant weights of different tablet matrices. 
      Basic tromethamine (Tris) was also included in each matrix as a pH modifier. 
      Swelling indices, rheological properties of the swollen matrices, and their 
      in-vitro drug release in simulating gastric fluid were assessed. The higher the 
      ratio of casein in the tablet matrix, the lower its swelling index and the higher 
      its viscosity indicate a shear thickening property. Intuitively, zero order drug 
      diffusion in 0.1 N HCl prevailed for more than 8 hours from this gelled matrix. 
      Both reduction of blood glucose level up till 11 hours and x-ray imaging of the 
      selected tablets in the GIT of rabbits correlated well with the shear thickening 
      properties. These findings propose a new stable, simple and affordable price 
      matrix with large versatility.

      diabetes mellitus (DM) is complicated by many factors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this 
      article was to systematically review evidence on the effectiveness of dipeptidyl 
      peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (ie, lowering of glycosylated hemoglobin 
      [HbA(1c)]), the risk of hypoglycemia associated with these agents, and the 
      effects of these agents on body weight in elderly patients with type 2 DM. 
      METHODS: The PubMed and Biosis databases were searched for reports of clinical 
      trials and meeting presentations (eg, abstracts, posters) published in English 
      between January 1, 2000, and October 25, 2009, that included elderly patients 
      with type 2 DM who were treated with sitagliptin, saxagliptin, vildagliptin, 
      alogliptin, BI-1356, DSP-7238, or PF-734200. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      studies were excluded from the review, as were studies that did not specifically 
      provide quantitative clinical data on glycemic parameters or specifically list 
      patients aged ≥65 years. RESULTS: Eighty-five articles and 5 presentations were 
      identified in the search; of those, 18 articles and 3 presentations were included 
      in the review. These publications described studies of DPP-4 inhibitors 
      administered as monotherapy or in combination with metformin, a 
      thiazolidinedione, glimepiride, glibenclamide, or insulin. Quantitative data 
      indicated that, in these elderly patients (generally defined as ≥65 years of age) 
      with type 2 DM, DPP-4 inhibitors were associated with significant HbA(1c) 
      reductions that ranged from ~0.7% (baseline HbA(1c) = 7.8%; P < 0.001) to 1.2% 
      (baseline HbA(1c) = 8.3%; P < 0.05). Additional studies that did not quantify the 
      number of elderly patients (as would a subanalysis), but did specify that elderly 
      patients were included and that patient age did not influence the results, were 
      incorporated in this review to support the quantitative results. No significant 
      differences were noted in the HbA(1c)-lowering effects of these agents between 
      elderly and younger patients. Less information about the incidence of 
      hypoglycemia or weight gain in elderly patients was reported, but the available 
      results suggested that the risk of hypoglycemia with DPP-4 inhibitors was not 
      significantly different from that with placebo (sitagliptin 50 or 100 mg/d [0%] 
      vs placebo [0%]; saxagliptin 5 mg/d [6.3%] vs placebo [8.0%]; vildagliptin 100 
      mg/d [2.32 events per patient-year] vs placebo [2.64 events per patient-year]; 
      alogliptin 12.5 mg/d [8.0%] vs placebo [10.5%]) and that these agents were weight 
      neutral (change, ≤0.9 kg). CONCLUSIONS: For elderly patients with type 2 DM, 
      reductions in HbA(1c) after treatment with a DPP-4 inhibitor were not 
      significantly different from those in younger patients. Use of DPP-4 inhibitors 
      in these studies was associated with a low risk of hypoglycemia, and these agents 
      were weight neutral.

AB  - A novel, sensitive, and green micellar UPLC method was proposed and validated for 
      the simultaneous determination of four hypoglycemic agents used in type II 
      diabetes mellitus treatment namely, pioglitazone, alogliptin, glimepiride, and 
      vildagliptin. The developed UPLC method was successfully applied for quantitative 
      analysis of these drugs in bulk, in pharmaceutical formulations, and in spiked 
      human plasma. Chromatographic separation was carried out on a Kinetex® 1.7 μm 
      XB-C18 100 Å (50 × 2.1 mm) column, using a degassed and filtered mixture of 
      (0.1 M SDS- 0.3% triethyl amine- 0.1% phosphoric acid (pH 6)) and n-propanol 
      (85:15 v/v), at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The experimental conditions of the 
      suggested method were well investigated and optimized. The newly developed 
      micellar UPLC method is capable of determining different dosage forms at the same 
      time with the same solvents, saving time and effort. The method was found to be 
      efficiently applicable in spiked human plasma and could be extended to study the 
      pharmacokinetics of the cited drugs in real human plasma samples. The greenness 
      of the developed method was evaluated by applying the Eco-scale scoring tool, 
      which verified the excellent greenness of the analytical method.

AB  - Liraglutide (Victoza) is an acylated analogue of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
      indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In phase III studies, 
      once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide improved glycaemic control compared with 
      placebo or active comparator in adult patients with type 2 diabetes, both as 
      monotherapy and in combination with one or two oral antidiabetic drugs such as 
      metformin, sulfonylureas or thiazolidinediones. Liraglutide provided 
      significantly better glycaemic control than rosiglitazone or insulin glargine in 
      combination trials. At appropriate dosages, liraglutide was noninferior to 
      glimepiride with respect to glycaemic control in a combination trial, but 
      provided significantly better control than glimepiride or glibenclamide in 
      monotherapy trials. Liraglutide improved pancreatic beta-cell function, generally 
      led to weight loss, and was associated with a low risk of hypoglycaemia. 
      Liraglutide was generally well tolerated, with the most common adverse events 
      being gastrointestinal events, such as nausea, which decreased over time. Thus, 
      liraglutide is an effective treatment option for use in patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus.

AB  - Quick and specific bioanalytical methods are required for analyzing drugs in 
      biological samples. A simple, quick, sensitive, and specific UPLC-MS/MS method 
      was developed and validated for glibenclamide determination in plasma samples. 
      The plasma samples were processed by protein precipitation technique. Glimepiride 
      was used as internal standard (IS). Glibenclamide and glimepiride were eluted on 
      C18 column (Acquity UPLC®BEH). Mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile (0.1% 
      formic acid) and water (0.1% formic acid) was pumped in binary gradient mode at 
      flow rate of 150 μL/min. Glibenclamide and IS elution time was about 1.0 min, and 
      total run time was 2.0 min. The mass spectrometer (triple-quadrupole) was 
      operated in positive electrospray ionization mode. Sodium adducts [M + Na](+) of 
      glibenclamide and IS were monitored in MRM mode. A linear calibration curve was 
      obtained in the range of 10-1280 ng/mL, with regression equation Y = 0.0076 X - 
      0.0165 and linear regression coefficient r(2) = 0.999. Lower limit of 
      quantitation was 10 ng/mL. Accuracy of the method at LQC, MQC, and HQC was 109.7% 
      (± 6.7), 93.6% (± 0.4), and 99.3% (± 1.9), respectively. The coefficient of 
      variation for precision at all QC concentrations was less than 6%. Recovery at 
      LLQC, MQC, and HQC was 104.2% (± 4.9), 100.6% (± 0.9), and 102.9% (± 5.8), 
      respectively. The method was successfully implemented for pharmacokinetic 
      investigations (in-house data).

TI  - Pharmacology, efficacy and safety of liraglutide in the management of type 2 
      diabetes.
PG  - 215-26
AB  - Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 analog with pharmacokinetic properties 
      suitable for once-daily administration approved by the Food and Drug 
      Administration for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. Clinical trial 
      data from large, controlled studies demonstrate the safety and efficacy of 
      liraglutide in terms of hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) reduction, reductions in body 
      weight, and the drug's low risk for hypoglycemic events when used as monotherapy. 
      Liraglutide has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, 
      glimepiride, and rosiglitazone for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. 
      Additionally, comparative data with insulin glargine and exenatide therapy are 
      available from Phase III trials. Once-daily administration may provide a 
      therapeutic advantage for liraglutide over twice-daily exenatide, with similar 
      improvements in HbA(1c) and body weight observed when liraglutide was compared 
      with exenatide. The glucose-dependent mechanism of insulin release with incretin 
      analog therapy holds potential clinical significance in the management of 
      postprandial hyperglycemic excursions, with minimal risk of hypoglycemia when 
      used with non-secretagogue medications. Data to date on patient-reported outcomes 
      with liraglutide treatment are encouraging. The most common adverse events 
      associated with liraglutide therapy are dose-dependent nausea, vomiting, and 
      diarrhea. Diligent postmarketing surveillance to elucidate the risk of 
      pancreatitis and medullary thyroid carcinoma in a heterogeneous population are 
      likely warranted.

TI  - Estimating kidney function and use of oral antidiabetic drugs in elderly.
PG  - 321-8
LID - 10.1111/fcp.12118 [doi]
AB  - The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and renal impairment rises with age 
      making regular estimation of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in older diabetics 
      necessary. This study investigated the differences among available estimating 
      equations in assessing eGFR in older diabetics and examined the use of oral 
      antidiabetic drugs (OADs) in relation to renal function. Patients with DM were 
      participants of the Berlin Initiative Study (BIS), a population-based cohort 
      study initiated in 2009 in Berlin, Germany, to evaluate kidney function in people 
      ≥70 years. GFR was estimated with the creatinine-based CKD-EPICREA (Chronic 
      Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration), the MDRD (Modification of Diet in 
      Renal Diseases) and the BIS1 equation and was directly measured (mGFR) with 
      iohexol clearance as a gold standard in a subgroup (n = 137). Creatinine 
      clearance was estimated with the Cockcroft-Gault equation (CrCl). DM prevalence 
      was 26% (539 of 2070 overall participants). The antidiabetic drugs most commonly 
      used among OAD patients were metformin (67%), glimepiride (27%) and glibenclamide 
      (14%). Three of ten metformin patients had a CrCl <60 mL/min. Compared to mGFR, 
      the mean differences of filtration rates calculated by MDRD, CKD-EPICREA and BIS1 
      were +8.9, +6.7 and -1.8 mL/min/1.73 m(2) , respectively. Summing up, many 
      patients with a CrCl <60 mL/min received metformin, although this represents a 
      contraindication in Germany. Glibenclamide was commonly used despite its 
      classification as potentially inappropriate medication in older adults. Finally, 
      BIS1 performed better in estimating GFR in older diabetics than MDRD or 
      CKD-EPICREA .

TI  - Novel liquid chromatographic method for simultaneous estimation of pioglitazone 
      and glimepiride in rat plasma by solid phase extraction: application to 
      preclinical pharmacokinetic studies.
PG  - 23-31
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1296164 [doi]
AB  - The need for a reliable bioanalytical method is of primary importance during 
      preclinical studies. The aim of the present study was simultaneous determination 
      of pioglitazone (CAS 111025-46-8) (PIO) and glimepiride (CAS 93479-97-1) (GLM) in 
      plasma of rats. A high-performance liquid chromatographic method has been 
      developed and validated using C18 column and UV detector. A mobile phase composed 
      of acetonitrile and ammonium acetate buffer pH 4.5 in the ratio of 55:45%. The 
      plasma samples clean-up was carried out using solid phase cartridges. The method 
      was in the linear range of 50-8000 ng/mL for PIO and 50-2000 ng/mL for GLM. The 
      coefficient of regression was found to be > or = 0.99. Precision and accuracy 
      were within the acceptable limits, as indicated by relative standard deviation 
      varying from 1.5 to 6.1% for PIO and 3.1 to 7.0% for GLM whereas the accuracy 
      ranged from 97.0 to 106.4% for PIO and 96.5 to 106.4% for GLM. The mean 
      extraction recovery was found to be 90.2 +/- 4.5, 76.8 +/- 2.8 and 85.2 +/- 5.2% 
      for PIO, GLM and internal standard, respectively. Moreover, PIO and GLM were 
      stable in plasma, up to 30 days of storage at -70 degrees C and after being 
      subjected to bench top, auto-sampler, and three freeze-thaw cycles. The developed 
      method was applied for preclinical pharmacokinetic studies.

TI  - Pharmaceutical quality evaluation of different glimepiride brands marketed in 
      Karachi (Pakistan): In pursuance to global issue of availability and 
      affordability of quality medicines.
PG  - 2709-2715
AB  - Availability of economical quality medicines is always required for chronic 
      disease management. Price differences among multiple brands of a product do not 
      essentially displays low quality for the more affordable brand, however in a few 
      occurrences it appears. Glimepiride, an oral anti-diabetic drug, is produced by 
      several national and multinational industries in Pakistan with considerable cost 
      variation. The study aimed to evaluate the quality and economy of various 
      Glimepiride brands available in Karachi, specifically of public sector hospitals. 
      For this, eight glimepiride brands were collected and analyzed for the 
      pharmaceutical quality using physical parameters, disintegration test, 
      dissolution profile, spectrophotometric assay and content uniformity. 
      Pharmacoeconomic assessment was also carried out such as availability, 
      affordability and price variation. A profound discrepancy was observed among the 
      prices of selected brands. All of the products found to be equivalent to the 
      reference product except G5, the most inexpensive and highest consumed product of 
      a public sector hospital. Study concludes that products with higher quality and 
      lesser price can be used as a substitute to the costly brands while availability 
      of a substandard product looks for consideration of pertinent authorities to 
      assure the distribution of quality medicines.

TI  - Implications of Pharmacokinetic Potentials of Pioglitazone Enantiomers in Rat 
      Plasma Mediated through Glucose Uptake Assay.
LID - 10.3390/molecules28134911 [doi]
LID - 4911
AB  - Pioglitazone, a PPAR-gamma activator used to diagnose hyperglycemia, was studied 
      for its stereoselective deposition and active enantiomers in female albino Wistar 
      rats. In accordance with USFDA recommendations, a bioanalytical technique was 
      employed to assess the segregation of pioglitazone enantiomers in rat plasma with 
      glimepiride as an internal standard. A Phenomenox i-Amylose-3 column (150 mm × 
      4.6 mm) of 5 µm was used for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a 
      mobile phase of 10 mM ammonium acetate buffer in Millipore water and acetonitrile 
      in 60:40 (v/v) admixture with column temperature 35 °C, wavelength 265 nm, and 
      flow rate 0.6 mL/min, respectively. Pioglitazone-S, Pioglitazone-R, and the 
      internal standard had retention times of 3.1, 7.4, and 1.7 min, respectively. The 
      study found that within-run and between-run precision ranged from 0.1606-0.9889% 
      for Pioglitazone-R and from 0.2080-0.7919% for Pioglitazone-S, while the accuracy 
      ranged from 99.86 to 100.36% for Pioglitazone-R and 99.84 to 99.94% for 
      Pioglitazone-S. In addition, a non-radioactive glucose uptake assay was employed 
      to examine the enantiomers in 3T3-L1 cell lines by flow cytometry. Significant 
      differences were demonstrated in Cmax, AUClast (h*μg/mL), AUCINF obs (h*μg/mL), 
      and AUC%Extrap obs (%) of Pioglitazone-R and S in female albino Wistar rats, 
      suggesting enantioselectivity of pioglitazone.

TI  - Dose Linearity of Glimepiride in Healthy Human Egyptian Volunteers.
PG  - 264-9
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.20 [doi]
AB  - The present study was adopted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and dose linearity 
      of glimepiride after administration of single oral doses of 1-6 mg glimepiride in 
      an open-label, five-way crossover study. Twenty-four healthy male Egyptian 
      volunteers were given 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 mg of glimepiride on five occasions, and 
      blood samples were collected over 24 hours. Plasma glimepiride concentrations 
      were assayed by a validated reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography 
      method with UV detection and the data were evaluated by non-compartmental methods 
      to determine pharmacokinetic parameters. The mean elimination half-lives (t1/2 ) 
      did not vary with the dose. The peak plasma levels (Cmax ) and area under the 
      plasma level versus time curve (AUC) data showed dose-proportional response. The 
      time to peak plasma concentration (tmax ), mean residence time, oral clearance 
      (Cl/F) and apparent volume of distribution (Vd /F) were all similar regardless of 
      the administered dose (P > .05). The 90% confidence intervals of the ratios of 
      dose-adjusted log transformed values of Cmax , AUC0-t , AUC0-∞ , t1/2 , and tmax 
      fell within the range of 80-125%. These findings suggest that glimepiride 
      disposition is linear over the dose range studied healthy human Egyptian 
      volunteers.

TI  - Development of a rapid method for the determination of glimepiride in human 
      plasma using liquid-liquid extraction based on 96-well format micro-tubes and 
      liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.
PG  - 2055-61
AB  - A semi-automated liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method 
      was developed for the determination of glimepiride in human plasma. The plasma 
      samples were treated by liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) in 1.2 mL 96-well format 
      micro-tubes. Glimepiride and the internal standard (IS) glibenclamide were 
      extracted from human plasma by LLE, using a mixture of ethyl acetate/diethyl 
      ether 50:50 (v/v) as the organic solvent. After vortexing, centrifugation and 
      freezing, the supernatant organic solvent was evaporated. The analyte and IS were 
      dissolved in a small volume of a reconstitution solution, an aliquot of which was 
      analyzed by reversed-phase LC/MS/MS with positive ion electrospray ionization, 
      using multiple reaction monitoring. The method proved to be sensitive and 
      specific for both drugs, and statistical evaluation revealed excellent linearity 
      for the range of concentrations 2.0-500.0 ng/mL with very good accuracy and 
      inter- and intra-day precisions. The proposed method enabled the rapid and 
      reliable determination of glimepiride in pharmacokinetic or bioequivalence 
      studies after per os administration of a 3 or 4 mg tablet of glimepiride.

TI  - Detection of antidiabetic activity by crude paratoid gland secretions from common 
      Indian toad (bufomelano stictus).
PG  - 429-33
LID - 10.4103/0976-9668.160027 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Amphibians have provided a remarkable array of biological active 
      compounds, which are secreted from socalled granular skin glands which serve to 
      protect the amphibians from predators due to its noxious effects on buccal tissue 
      and at least in the case of some peptides, to protect from bacterial (or) 
      protozoan infections. Given the respiratory and antimicrobial functions of 
      amphibian skin, it is likely that some of the novel molecules found in amphibian 
      granular gland secretions might be of use in the treatment of skin and 
      respiratory infections. Secretions from common Indian toad (Bufo melanostictus) a 
      member of Bufonidae family has the history of medicinal use however the 
      anti-diabetic activity is not reported. The present study is aimed to determine 
      whether paratoid gland extract have any influence on the diabetes and the 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glimepiride (GLM) in normal and diabetic 
      rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An aqueous and methanolic extracts of paratoid 
      glandular secretions were prepared, air dried and used to determine the 
      antidiabetic activity in rats. The blood sampling was done at preset time 
      intervals between 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 h, using heparinized capillaries. 
      The blood glucose levels are estimated by glucose oxidase-peroxidase method, and 
      reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography is used to determine the 
      pharmacokinetic parameters of GLM using glibenclamide as an internal standard. 
      RESULTS: Both the aqueous and methanolic extracts produced better glycemic 
      control in diabetic rats, and methanolic extract is better than the aqueous 
      extract. Serum concentrations of GLM increased at 2(nd) h, and the percentage 
      glucose reduction is maximal at the 4(th) h with both aqueous and methanolic 
      extracts of paratoid secretions of common Indian toad. CONCLUSIONS: Paratoid 
      gland secretions of the common Indian toad is antidiabetic, in addition it has 
      beneficial effects in combination with GLM. Further, it requires the systematic 
      structure elucidation of the compounds and pharmacokinetic studies to explore the 
      beneficial effects.

TI  - Inhibitory effects of sulfonylureas and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on 
      in vitro metabolism of canagliflozin in human liver microsomes.
PG  - 135-142
LID - 10.1002/bdd.2120 [doi]
AB  - Canagliflozin, used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is commonly 
      co-administered with sulfonylureas. The objective of the present study was to 
      evaluate the possible inhibitory effect of sulfonylureas and non-steroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on canagliflozin metabolism in vitro. Three 
      sulfonylurea derivatives were evaluated as inhibitors: chlorpropamide, 
      glimepiride and gliclazide. Two other NSAIDs were used as positive control 
      inhibitors: niflumic acid and diclofenac. The rate of formation of canagliflozin 
      metabolites was determined by HPLC analysis of in vitro incubations of 
      canagliflozin as a substrate with and without inhibitors, using human liver 
      microsomes (HLMs). Among sulfonylureas, glimepiride showed the most potent 
      inhibitory effect against canagliflozin M7 metabolite formation, with an IC(50) 
      value of 88 μm, compared to chlorpropamide and gliclazide with IC(50) values of 
      more than 500 μm. Diclofenac inhibited M5 metabolite formation more than M7, with 
      IC(50) values of 32 μm for M5 and 80 μm for M7. Niflumic acid showed no 
      inhibition activity against M5 formation, but had relatively selective inhibitory 
      potency against M7 formation, which is catalysed by UGT1A9, with an IC(50) value 
      of 1.9 μm and an inhibition constant value of 0.8 μm. A clinical pharmacokinetic 
      interaction between canagliflozin and sulfonylureas is unlikely. However, a 
      possible clinically important drug interaction between niflumic acid and 
      canagliflozin has been identified.

TI  - Development of Multi-Compartment 3D-Printed Tablets Loaded with 
      Self-Nanoemulsified Formulations of Various Drugs: A New Strategy for 
      Personalized Medicine.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics13101733 [doi]

AB  - This work aimed to develop a three-dimensional printed (3DP) tablet containing 
      glimepiride (GLMP) and/or rosuvastatin (RSV) for treatment of dyslipidemia in 
      patients with diabetes. Curcumin oil was extracted from the dried rhizomes of 
      Curcuma longa and utilized to develop a self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system 
      (SNEDDS). Screening mixture experimental design was conducted to develop SNEDDS 
      formulation with a minimum droplet size. Five different semi-solid pastes were 
      prepared and rheologically characterized. The prepared pastes were used to 
      develop 3DP tablets using extrusion printing. The quality attributes of the 3DP 
      tablets were evaluated. A non-compartmental extravascular pharmacokinetic model 
      was implemented to investigate the in vivo behavior of the prepared tablets and 
      the studied marketed products. The optimized SNEDDS, of a 94.43 ± 3.55 nm droplet 
      size, was found to contain 15%, 75%, and 10% of oil, polyethylene glycol 400, and 
      tween 80, respectively. The prepared pastes revealed a shear-thinning of 
      pseudoplastic flow behavior. Flat-faced round tablets of 15 mm diameter and 
      5.6-11.2 mm thickness were successfully printed and illustrated good criteria for 
      friability, weight variation, and content uniformity. Drug release was superior 
      from SNEDDS-based tablets when compared to non-SNEDDS tablets. Scanning electron 
      microscopy study of the 3DP tablets revealed a semi-porous surface that exhibited 
      some curvature with the appearance of tortuosity and a gel porous-like structure 
      of the inner section. GLMP and RSV demonstrated relative bioavailability of 
      159.50% and 245.16%, respectively. Accordingly, the developed 3DP tablets could 
      be considered as a promising combined oral drug therapy used in treatment of 
      metabolic disorders. However, clinical studies are needed to investigate their 
      efficacy and safety.

AB  - This study compared the effect of Glimepiride versus Vildagliptin on β-cell 
      function and the release of intact proinsulin (PI) in patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus. Patients on metformin monotherapy were randomized to add on 
      treatment with Vildagliptin or Glimepiride. A standardized test meal was given at 
      baseline, after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. Insulin, PI and blood glucose 
      values were measured in the fasting state and postprandial for 300 min. Fasting 
      PI levels significantly decreased in the Vildagliptin group. The area under the 
      curve for the postprandial release of PI decreased during Vildagliptin and 
      increased during Glimepiride treatment. The proinsulin to insulin ratio declined 
      in the Vildagliptin group, whereas it did not change significantly in the 
      Glimepiride group. Addition of Vildagliptin to ongoing Metformin treatment 
      reconstitutes the disproportionality of the proinsulin to insulin secretion from 
      the β cell.

TI  - Biomedical Informatics Approaches to Identifying Drug-Drug Interactions: 
      Application to Insulin Secretagogues.
PG  - 459-468
LID - 10.1097/EDE.0000000000000638 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug-drug interactions with insulin secretagogues are associated with 
      increased risk of serious hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. We aimed 
      to systematically screen for drugs that interact with the five most commonly used 
      secretagogues-glipizide, glyburide, glimepiride, repaglinide, and nateglinide-to 
      cause serious hypoglycemia. METHODS: We screened 400 drugs frequently 
      coprescribed with the secretagogues as candidate interacting precipitants. We 
      first predicted the drug-drug interaction potential based on the pharmacokinetics 
      of each secretagogue-precipitant pair. We then performed pharmacoepidemiologic 
      screening for each secretagogue of interest, and for metformin as a negative 
      control, using an administrative claims database and the self-controlled case 
      series design. The overall rate ratios (RRs) and those for four predefined risk 
      periods were estimated using Poisson regression. The RRs were adjusted for 
      multiple estimation using semi-Bayes method, and then adjusted for metformin 
      results to distinguish native effects of the precipitant from a drug-drug 
      interaction. RESULTS: We predicted 34 pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with 
      the secretagogues, nine moderate and 25 weak. There were 140 and 61 
      secretagogue-precipitant pairs associated with increased rates of serious 
      hypoglycemia before and after the metformin adjustment, respectively. The results 
      from pharmacokinetic prediction correlated poorly with those from 
      pharmacoepidemiologic screening. CONCLUSIONS: The self-controlled case series 
      design has the potential to be widely applicable to screening for drug-drug 
      interactions that lead to adverse outcomes identifiable in healthcare databases. 
      Coupling pharmacokinetic prediction with pharmacoepidemiologic screening did not 
      notably improve the ability to identify drug-drug interactions in this case.

TI  - Sulfonylureas and Metformin Were Not Associated With an Increased Rate of Serious 
      Bleeding in Warfarin Users: A Self-Controlled Case Series Study.
PG  - 1010-1017
LID - 10.1002/cpt.1885 [doi]
AB  - Drug interactions between warfarin and sulfonylureas are suggested by 
      pharmacokinetic information and prior studies. However, clinical evidence on the 
      association of such interactions and the risk of bleeding is lacking. Using 
      healthcare claims data from 5 US Medicaid programs from 1999-2011 and a 
      self-controlled case series design with warfarin as an object drug, we calculated 
      confounder-adjusted rate ratios (RRs) for concomitant use of sulfonylureas and 
      metformin for 3 outcomes separately: (i) serious bleeding as a composite outcome 
      of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage 
      (ICH); (ii) GIB; and (iii) ICH. In 6,463 warfarin users experiencing serious 
      bleeding, an increased rate of serious bleeding was not associated with 
      concomitant use of glimepiride (RR: 0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI) 
      0.75-1.15), glipizide (RR: 0.97; 95% CI 0.84-1.13), glyburide (RR: 0.89; 95% CI 
      0.76-1.06), or metformin (RR: 0.85; 95% CI 0.76-0.96), nor was the occurrence of 
      the component outcomes of GIB or ICH. These results suggest that use of 
      sulfonylureas or metformin was not associated with an increased rate of serious 
      bleeding in warfarin users.

PG  - S33-42
AB  - Glimepiride is a new generation sulphonylurea being prudently characterized in 
      more than 2000 NIDDM patients. It has a short onset of action and a long duration 
      of action. The same pharmacodynamic effect as with traditional sulphonylureas is 
      achieved with secretion of less insulin, suggesting a possible extrapancreatic 
      action. Glimepiride is given once daily in doses from 1-8 mg/day. 100% absolute 
      bioavailability and the absence of a food interaction guarantee highly 
      reproducible pharmacokinetics. Glimepiride is a remarkably safe drug especially 
      in NIDDM patients at high risk e.g. the renally impaired, elderly or physically 
      very active person. Hypoglycemia is less frequent in the first weeks of treatment 
      than with glibenclamide. Ongoing studies are investigating the possible 
      beneficial clinical effect of its different binding behavior to the potassium 
      channel, especially in the heart.

TI  - Interaction of Organic Anion Transporter 3-Mediated Uptake of Steviol Acyl 
      Glucuronide, a Major Metabolite of Rebaudioside A, with Selected Drugs.
PG  - 1579-1587
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.9b05808 [doi]
AB  - Organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) plays a critical role in the renal excretion 
      of many xenobiotics. Because steviol acyl glucuronide (SVAG), an OAT3 substrate, 
      is the major circulating metabolite after oral ingestion of steviol glycosides 
      and is excreted into the urine, inhibition of OAT3 activity may alter 
      pharmacokinetic profiles of SVAG. The present study showed that drugs such as 
      probenecid and glimepiride displayed potent inhibition toward the OAT3-mediated 
      SVAG transport, with IC(50) values of 4.9 and 0.8 μM, respectively. No species 
      differences were observed. Probenecid and glimepiride could significantly elevate 
      plasma concentrations of SVAG after oral administration of rebaudioside A, with 
      significant increases in plasma maximum (C(max)) and area under the plasma 
      time-concentration curve values. The inhibitory effect on the OAT3-mediated SVAG 
      transport exemplified a unique case between drugs and the metabolite of a food 
      additive. Our data suggest that caution should be exercised when giving steviol 
      glycoside products to human subjects with compromised renal function.

TI  - Prediction of drug disposition in diabetic patients by means of a physiologically

PG  - 179-93

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Accumulating evidence has shown that diabetes mellitus 
      may affect the pharmacokinetics of some drugs, leading to alteration of 
      pharmacodynamics and/or toxic effects. The aim of this study was to develop a 
      novel physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for predicting drug 
      pharmacokinetics in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus quantitatively. 
      METHODS: Contributions of diabetes-induced alteration of physiological parameters 
      including gastric emptying rates, intestinal transit time, drug metabolism in 
      liver and kidney functions were incorporated into the model. Plasma 
      concentration-time profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters of seven drugs 
      (antipyrine, nisoldipine, repaglinide, glibenclamide, glimepiride, chlorzoxazone, 
      and metformin) in non-diabetic and diabetic patients were predicted using the 
      developed model. The PBPK model coupled with a Monte-Carlo simulation was also 
      used to predict the means and variability of pharmacokinetic parameters. RESULTS: 
      The predicted area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum 
      (peak) concentration (C max) were reasonably consistent (<2-fold errors) with the 
      reported values. Sensitivity analysis showed that gut transit time, hepatic 
      enzyme activity, and renal function affected the pharmacokinetic characteristics 
      of these drugs. Shortened gut transit time only decreased the AUC of 
      controlled-released drugs and drugs with low absorption rates. Impairment of 
      renal function markedly altered pharmacokinetics of drugs mainly eliminated via 
      the kidneys. CONCLUSION: All of these results indicate that the developed PBPK 
      model can quantitatively predict pharmacokinetic alterations induced by diabetes.

AB  - The current situation of diabetes prevention and control is extremely severe. For 
      instance, glimepiride (GLM), a third-generation sulfonylurea, demonstrates 
      suboptimal clinical efficacy in oral dosage forms, which underscores the pressing 
      need for the development of a new dosage form. Recently, in situ gel subcutaneous 
      implants have garnered considerable attention. Hydroxybutyl chitosan (HBC) can 
      spontaneously crosslink to form a thermosensitive hydrogel and has good 
      biocompatibility. However, its application is hindered by its limited mechanical 
      properties. Graphene oxide (GO), known for its stable dispersion in water, can 
      load GLM through π-π stacking interactions. When combined with HBC, GO enhances 
      the mechanical properties and stability of the hydrogel. Therefore, an HBC-GO@GLM 
      hydrogel was prepared. Rheological analysis revealed that the incorporation of GO 
      increased the critical gelation temperature of the 5 wt% HBC hydrogel from 19.1°C 
      to 27.2°C, considerably enhancing the mechanical properties of the hydrogel. 
      Using encapsulation efficiency as an evaluation index, the optimal encapsulation 
      efficiency of GO@GLM was determined to be 73.53% ± 0.45% with a drug loading 
      capacity of 27.39 ± 0.17% using the Box-Behnken design model. Computer simulation 
      technology validated the interaction between the materials and the drug release 
      mechanism. Pharmacokinetic results showed that compared to the HBC@GLM group, the 
      half-life (t1/2), mean residence time and the area under the curve for the 
      HBC-GO@GLM group were approximately 3 times those of the HBC@GLM group. 
      Subcutaneous implantation of the HBC-GO@GLM hydrogel for drug delivery 
      considerably extended the drug's action time in the body, thereby maintaining 
      blood sugar levels within a normal and stable range for an extended period.

AB  - The vaginal administration route suffers from relatively low absorption 
      efficiency, which may hinder the identification of the toxicokinetics of curdione 
      in pregnant women. A sensitive analytical method for determining the plasma 
      concentration of curdione was developed and applied in the determination of 
      curdione in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats as a simulated model. Glimepiride was 
      used as an internal standard and chromatographic separation was achieved on a 
      Capcell Pak C18 MGIII column. A gradient elution profile with 0.5% formic acid 
      (A)-0.5% formic acid-acetonitrile (B) was selected as mobile phase. The selected 
      reaction monitoring mode was used for quantification based on the target fragment 
      ions m/z 237.2 to m/z 135.1 for curdione and m/z 491.3 to m/z 352.1 for the 
      glimepiride. The standard curve was linear over the range of 0.5-500 ng/mL for 
      curdione in rat plasma and yielded a consistent peak pattern, even at the lower 
      limit of quantitation of 0.5 ng/mL. The retention times of curdione and IS were 
      6.55 and 6.59 min, respectively. The mean recovery of curdione in rat plasma was 
      95.5-101.1%. The intra-day and inter-day precisions were between 2.35 and 9.08%. 
      This LC-MS/MS method provides a simple and sensitive means for determining the 
      plasma concentration.

PG  - 196-200
LID - 10.4103/0975-1483.63169 [doi]
AB  - Aim of this investigation was to study the in vivo and in vitro drug interaction 
      of glimepride with atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. In vitro drug interaction of 
      glimepride with atorvastatin and rosuvastatin was studied using human pooled 
      liver microsomes and evaluated using high performance liquid chromatography. In 
      vivo pharmacokinetic drug interaction of glimepride (6 mg/kg) in coadministration 
      with atorvastatin (60 mg/kg) and rosuvastatin (60 mg/kg) were studied in rats and 
      analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In in 
      vitro study, atorvastatin decreased its own metabolism as well as the metabolism 
      of glimepiride. Rosuvastatin coadministration with glimepride reduced the 
      metabolism of glimepride and increased the metabolism of its own. In in vivo 
      study, concentration in plasma, C(max), AUC((0-t)) and AUC((0-∞)) (area under the 
      concentration-time curve, AUC) of glimepride was increased significantly in 
      coadministration with atorvastatin whereas there was no significant change was 
      observed in the case of coadministration with rosuvastatin. Half life (T(1/2)) 
      and volume of distribution (V(d)) of glimepride decreased significantly with both 
      atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. Elimination rate constant, K(el) of glimepride 
      increased significantly with both atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. Clearance (Cl) 
      of glimepride decreased significantly but the decrease was more with atorvastatin 
      than with rosuvastatin. It is concluded that glimepride metabolism is little 
      affected by rosuvastatin in vitro, which agreed with the negligible interaction 
      in in vivo study. Thus, from safety point of view rosuvastatin is better to 
      prescribe as a coadministration therapy with glimepiride. On the other hand, 
      atorvastatin could cause an increase in the bioavailability of glimepride per 
      oral and also significantly decrease the metabolism of glimerpride in in vitro 
      study. This may pose a positive implication in clinical practice.

TI  - Switch-backs associated with generic drugs approved using product-specific 
      determinations of therapeutic equivalence.
PG  - 944-52
LID - 10.1002/pds.4009 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: US Food and Drug Administration approval for generic drugs relies on 
      demonstrating pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence; however, some drug 
      products have unique attributes that necessitate product-specific approval 
      pathways. We evaluated rates of patients' switching back to brand-name versions 
      from generic versions of four drugs approved via such approaches. METHODS: We 
      used data from Optum LifeSciences Research Database to identify patients using a 
      brand-name version of a study drug (acarbose tablets, salmon calcitonin nasal 
      spray, enoxaparin sodium injection, and venlafaxine extended release tablets) or 
      a control drug. We followed patients to identify switching to generic versions 
      and then followed those who switched to identify whether they switched back to 
      brand-name versions. We calculated switch and switch-back rates and used 
      Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests to compare rates between study and control drugs. 
      RESULTS: Our cohort included 201 959 eligible patients. Brand-to-generic switch 
      rates ranged from 66 to 106 switches per 100 person-years for study drugs and 80 
      to 110 for control drugs. Rates of switch-back to brand-name versions ranged from 
      5 to 37 among study drugs and 3 to 53 among control drugs. Switch-back rates were 
      higher for venlafaxine vs. sertraline (p < 0.01) and calcitonin vs. alendronate 
      (p = 0.01). Switch-back rates were lower for venlafaxine vs. paroxetine 
      (p < 0.01) and acarbose vs. nateglinide (p < 0.01). Rates were similar for 
      acarbose vs. glimepiride (p = 0.97) and for enoxaparin vs. fondiparinux 
      (p = 0.11). CONCLUSION: As compared to control drugs, patients were not more 
      likely to systematically switch back from generic to brand-name versions of the 
      four study drugs. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - [Hypoglycemic risk of insulinotropic drugs].
PG  - 453-8
AB  - Orally available insulinotropics that directly close K(ATP)-channels, such as 
      sulfonylureas and glinides, differ in their pharmacokinetics and -dynamics 
      (PK/PD). This results in different risks for their incidence of hypoglycemic 
      episodes. Glibenclamide (USAN: glyburide) has the highest risk, followed by 
      glimepiride. Glinides reveal a low risk of hypoglycemia due to their short 
      duration of drug effect. Apart from PK/PD, clinically more relevant factors 
      determine incidences of hypoglycemia. Adequate supervision at initial 
      prescription or switch of insulinotropic drugs, comedication and patient 
      compliance superimpose these pharmacological differences.

TI  - Acute effect of glimepiride on insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism in 
      glucose-tolerant insulin-resistant offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 2065-73
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study addressed whether acute infusion of glimepiride influences 
      glucose metabolism independent of its effect on insulin secretion. RESEARCH 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten healthy, glucose-tolerant but insulin-resistant probands 
      were subjected to a placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study. Each 
      individual received infusions of either 0.15 mol/l saline or glimepiride in 
      randomized order on two separate occasions. A three-step hyperinsulinemic (0.5, 
      1.0, and 1.5 mU. kg(-1). min(-1))-euglycemic glucose clamp was performed on both 
      occasions to determine insulin sensitivity. Glimepiride-induced insulin secretion 
      was inhibited by octreotide. Endogenous glucose production and glucose 
      elimination were measured with the "hot" glucose infusion method using 
      U-[(13)C]glucose as tracer. Glucose oxidation was determined from indirect 
      calorimetry. Lipolysis was evaluated by measurements of nonesterified fatty acid 
      (NEFA) and glycerol concentration and measurement of glycerol production. 
      RESULTS: Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were not significantly 
      different between glimepiride or saline infusions. There was a significant 
      increase in the rate of glucose infusion necessary to maintain euglycemia during 
      infusion of glimepiride during the low- (12.2 +/- 1.1 vs. 16.1 +/- 1.7 micro mol. 
      kg(-1). min(-1)) and intermediate-dose insulin infusion (24.4 +/- 1.7 vs. 30.0 
      +/- 2.8 micro mol. kg(-1). min(-1)). This was explained by an increased rate of 
      glucose elimination and to a lesser degree by a decrease in glucose production. 
      Glucose oxidation rate was not different. NEFA and glycerol concentration and 
      glycerol production were equally suppressed. CONCLUSIONS: Glimepiride improves 
      peripheral glucose uptake and decreases endogenous glucose production independent 
      of its insulin secretagogue action. The effects shown in this acute study are, 
      however, too small to be considered therapeutically beneficial for the individual 
      patient.

TI  - A Sensitive HPLC-MS/MS Method for Determination of Obeticholic Acid in Human 
      Plasma: Application to a Pharmacokinetic Study in Healthy Volunteers.
PG  - 545-550
LID - 10.1093/chromsci/bmab098 [doi]
AB  - A rapid and sensitive LC-MS/MS method was developed and fully validated for the 
      determination of obeticholic acid in human plasma. Glimepiride was used as 
      internal standard. For this method, liquid-liquid extraction was performed to 
      extract analyte from the plasma samples. Chromatographic separation was performed 
      on a C18 (2.1 × 50 mm, 2.7 μm, Agilent) column with isocratic elution using water 
      containing 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid at a 
      flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The mass detection was performed in negative mode. The 
      precursor-product ion pairs for MRM were m/z 465.3 → 419.3 for obeticholic acid 
      and m/z 489.3 → 224.8 for the IS. The method exhibited great linearity over the 
      concentration range of 0.150-100 ng/mL for obeticholic acid. The sensitivity, 
      linearity, accuracy, precision, recovery, matrix effect and stability of this 
      method were all within the acceptable limits. The method was successfully 
      validated and applied to the pharmacokinetic studies in healthy Chinese 
      volunteers after a single oral dose administration of obeticholic acid tablets of 
      10 mg, and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of obeticholic acid in human were 
      reported for the first time.

TI  - The influence of oral antidiabetic drugs on cellular drug uptake mediated by 
      hepatic OATP family members.
PG  - 244-50
LID - 10.1111/bcpt.12031 [doi]
AB  - As patients with type 2 diabetes receiving oral antidiabetic drugs are often 
      concomitantly treated with other drugs, they are of increased risk for drug 
      interactions. Drugs have to be taken up into hepatocytes before their 
      intracellular drug action or before they are metabolized, and therefore, uptake 
      transporters are important modulators of drug pharmacokinetics and drug effects. 
      To gain more insights into the role of uptake transporters for drug interactions, 
      we investigated whether frequently prescribed oral antidiabetic drugs interact 
      with the transport of drugs, mediated by the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 
      (gene symbol SLCO1B1), OATP1B3 (gene symbol SLCO1B3) and OATP2B1 (gene symbol 
      SLCO2B1). Using HEK293 cells recombinantly over-expressing these uptake 
      transporters, we analysed whether glibenclamide, glimepiride, nateglinide and 
      pioglitazone influence the transport of the model transport substrate 
      bromosulfophthalein. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of the same oral 
      antidiabetic drugs and of repaglinide and rosiglitazone on the uptake of the 
      HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor atorvastatin. The oral antidiabetic drugs 
      glibenclamide, glimepiride and nateglinide inhibited the transport of the model 
      substrate bromosulfophthalein, particularly the OATP2B1-mediated uptake. The 
      OATP-mediated atorvastatin uptake was inhibited in a similar manner. For 
      glibenclamide, inhibitory constants (Ki values) of 13.6 μM, 8.1 μM and 0.5 μM for 
      OATP1B1-, OATP1B3- and OATP2B1-mediated BSP uptake were determined. In 
      conclusion, these in vitro results demonstrate that several oral antidiabetic 
      drugs may influence hepatic OATP-mediated drug uptake. The in vivo consequences 
      of these results have to be analysed in further studies.

TI  - Assessment of the Drug Interaction Potential of Ertugliflozin With Sitagliptin, 
      Metformin, Glimepiride, or Simvastatin in Healthy Subjects.
PG  - 314-325
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.472 [doi]
AB  - Ertugliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor for the treatment of 
      adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, is expected to be coadministered with 
      sitagliptin, metformin, glimepiride, and/or simvastatin. Four separate 
      open-label, randomized, single-dose, crossover studies were conducted in healthy 
      adults to assess the potential pharmacokinetic interactions between ertugliflozin 
      15 mg and sitagliptin 100 mg (n = 12), metformin 1000 mg (n = 18), glimepiride 1 
      mg (n = 18), or simvastatin 40 mg (n = 18). Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic 
      parameters derived from plasma concentration-time data were analyzed using 
      mixed-effects models to assess interactions. Coadministration of sitagliptin, 
      metformin, glimepiride, or simvastatin with ertugliflozin had no effect on area 
      under the plasma concentration-time profile from time 0 to infinity (AUC(inf) ) 
      or maximum observed plasma concentration (C(max) ) of ertugliflozin (per standard 
      bioequivalence boundaries, 80% to 125%). Similarly, ertugliflozin did not have 
      any impact on AUC(inf) or C(max) of sitagliptin, metformin, or glimepiride. 
      AUC(inf) for simvastatin (24%) and simvastatin acid (30%) increased slightly 
      after coadministration with ertugliflozin and was not considered clinically 
      relevant. All treatments were well tolerated. The lack of clinically meaningful 
      pharmacokinetic interactions demonstrates that ertugliflozin can be 
      coadministered safely with sitagliptin, metformin, glimepiride, or simvastatin 
      without any need for dose adjustment.

TI  - Absence of Drug-Drug Interactions Between Luseogliflozin, a Sodium-Glucose 
      Co-transporter-2 Inhibitor, and Various Oral Antidiabetic Drugs in Healthy 
      Japanese Males.
PG  - 404-17
LID - 10.1007/s12325-015-0209-1 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We investigated the possibilities of drug-drug interactions between 
      luseogliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, and oral 
      antidiabetic drugs (OADs) in healthy Japanese males. METHODS: We conducted six 
      independent studies to investigate potential drug-drug interactions between 5 mg 
      luseogliflozin and the following OADs usually used in Japan: 1 mg glimepiride, 
      250 mg metformin, 30 mg pioglitazone, 50 mg sitagliptin, 50 mg miglitol, or 0.6 
      mg voglibose (0.2 mg before each meal). Twelve subjects were enrolled in each 
      study. The glimepiride, metformin, sitagliptin, and miglitol studies were 
      randomized, open-label, single-dose, three-way crossover studies. The 
      pioglitazone and voglibose studies were open-label studies, where a single dose 
      of luseogliflozin was added to multiple doses of pioglitazone or voglibose. The 
      endpoints were the area under the curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24 h) or to infinity 
      (AUCinf) and the maximum concentration (Cmax) of each drug administered alone or 
      in combination. RESULTS: The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the geometric mean 
      ratio (GMR) for Cmax of luseogliflozin in the pioglitazone and miglitol studies 
      were beyond the reference range for bioequivalence (0.80-1.25) (miglitol: 0.851 
      [0.761, 0.952]; pioglitazone: 1.16 [1.04, 1.30]). However, the 90% CIs for 
      AUC0-24 h were within the reference range. The 90% CIs of the GMRs for Cmax and 
      AUC0-24 h of pioglitazone were beyond the reference range (Cmax 0.884 [0.746, 
      1.05]; AUC0-24 h 0.896 [0.774, 1.04]), but the 90% CIs for the active metabolites 
      of pioglitazone were within the reference range. For the other combinations 
      tested, the 90% CIs and GMRs for luseogliflozin and the individual OADs were 
      within the reference range. CONCLUSION: No clinically meaningful interactions 
      were observed between luseogliflozin and six commonly used OADs in Japan, 
      although there were some changes in the pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone 
      co-administered with luseogliflozin and for luseogliflozin co-administered with 
      miglitol or pioglitazone. FUNDING: Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

TI  - A Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Drug-Drug Interaction Study of Tofogliflozin (a 
      New SGLT2 Inhibitor) and Selected Anti-Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Drugs.
PG  - 74-81
LID - 10.1055/s-0035-1549967 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Tofogliflozin is an oral hypoglycemic agent with a novel mechanism of 
      action that reduces blood glucose levels by promoting glucose excretion in urine, 
      achieved by selectively inhibiting sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2). We 
      evaluated the effects of several selected anti-type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
      drugs-glimepiride, metformin, sitagliptin, pioglitazone, miglitol, nateglinide, 
      and voglibose-on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of tofogliflozin, and 
      the effects of tofogliflozin on the pharmacokinetics of these anti-T2DM drugs in 
      healthy male volunteers. METHODS: A single dose of either tofogliflozin alone, 
      one of the anti-T2DM drugs alone, or co-administration of tofogliflozin and the 
      anti-T2DM drug was administered to 108 healthy men. Cmax, AUCinf, and cumulative 
      urine glucose excretion after co-administration of tofogliflozin and each of the 
      anti-T2DM drugs was evaluated relative to the values of those parameters after 
      administration of each drug alone. RESULTS: None of the anti-T2DM drugs had any 
      effect on tofogliflozin exposure. Tofogliflozin had no or little effect on the 
      exposure of any anti-T2DM drug. No anti-T2DM drug had any major effect on the 
      cumulative urine glucose excretion induced by tofogliflozin. There were no safety 
      concerns evident after administration of any drug alone or in co-administration. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Neither the pharmacokinetics nor the pharmacodynamics of 
      tofogliflozin was affected by any of the anti-T2DM drugs evaluated in this study, 
      nor was the pharmacokinetics of any of the anti-T2DM drugs affected by 
      tofogliflozin in healthy male volunteers.

TI  - Bioequivalence assessment of the two brands of glimepiride tablets.
PG  - 1015-20
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Glimepiride, as an antidiabetic from the group of sulfonylurea, 
      is administered perorally in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The aim of this 
      study was to compare pharmacokinetic profiles and relative bioavailabilities of 
      the two oral formulations of glimepiride, generic and innovator tablets, after a 
      single dose of the active drug. METHODS: An oral dose of 6 mg glimepiride was 
      given under fasting conditions to 24 healthy volunteers. A one-week washout 
      period was applied between the two consecutive periods. The serum samples 
      obtained before dosing, and at various time points up to 48 hours, were analyzed 
      for glimepiride concentration using the validated high-performance liquid 
      chromatographic method with ultraviolet detection. Pharmacokinetic parameters 
      representing early (maximal concentration, time to reach maximal concentration) 
      and total exposure (area under the curve from the time 0 to the infinite time) to 
      glimepiride were obtained and further analyzed using the multifactorial analysis 
      of variance and the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Comparison of the 
      secondary kinetic variables was only descriptive. RESULTS: The point estimates of 
      the ratios of geometric means (test/reference) of maximal concentrations and 
      areas under the curve were 1.046 (90% confidence interval: 0.906-1.208) and 1.022 
      (90% confidence interval: 0.856-1.220), respectively, while the median values of 
      times to reach maximal concentration, at 5% level of significance, did not differ 
      significantly. Both formulations were well tolerated. Transient mild 
      hypoglycaemia, which had been noted in 6 participants, resolved spontaneously 
      within 30-60 minutes. CONCLUSION: Since all the parametric 90% confidence 
      intervals for the log-transformed main variables of glimepiride were within the 
      0.80 and 1.25 interval, accepted as the definition of bioequivalence, and the 
      differences in times to reach maximal concentration also did not reach 
      statistical significance, studied tablets were considered bioequivalent.

TI  - Drug-drug interactions between rosuvastatin and oral antidiabetic drugs occurring 
      at the level of OATP1B1.
PG  - 592-601
LID - 10.1124/dmd.112.049023 [doi]
AB  - Organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) is an important hepatic 
      uptake transporter, of which the polymorphic variant OATP1B1*15 (Asn130Asp and 
      Val174Ala) has been associated with decreased transport activity. Rosuvastatin is 
      an OATP1B1 substrate and often concomitantly prescribed with oral antidiabetics 
      in the clinic. The aim of this study was to investigate possible drug-drug 
      interactions between these drugs at the level of OATP1B1 and OATP1B1*15. We 
      generated human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells stably overexpressing OATP1B1 or 
      OATP1B1*15 that showed similar protein expression levels of OATP1B1 and 
      OATP1B1*15 at the cell membrane as measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry. In HEK-OATP1B1*15 cells, the V(max) for OATP1B1-mediated transport 
      of E(2)17β-G (estradiol 17β-d-glucuronide) was decreased >60%, whereas K(m) 
      values (Michaelis constant) were comparable. Uptake of rosuvastatin in 
      HEK-OATP1B1 cells (K(m) 13.1 ± 0.43 μM) was nearly absent in HEK-OATP1B1*15 
      cells. Interestingly, several oral antidiabetics (glyburide, glimepiride, 
      troglitazone, pioglitazone, glipizide, gliclazide, and tolbutamide), but not 
      metformin, were identified as significant inhibitors of the OATP1B1-mediated 
      transport of rosuvastatin. The IC(50) values for inhibition of E(2)17β-G uptake 
      were similar between OATP1B1 and OATP1B1*15. In conclusion, these studies 
      indicate that several oral antidiabetic drugs affect the OATP1B1-mediated uptake 
      of rosuvastatin in vitro. The next step will be to translate these data to the 
      clinical situation, as it remains to be established whether the studied oral 
      antidiabetics indeed affect the clinical pharmacokinetic profile of rosuvastatin 
      in patients.

TI  - Bioequivalence Comparison of Two Formulations of Fixed-Dose Combination 
      Glimepiride/Metformin (2/500 mg)Tablets in Healthy Volunteers.
PG  - 365-71
AB  - Glimepiride/metformin (2/500 mg) is an oral antihyperglycemic agent for the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes. A generic glimepiride/metformin (2/500 mg) 
      fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet was developed recently. This study was 
      designed to collect data for submission to Korean regulatory authorities to allow 
      the marketing of the test formulation. We evaluated the comparative 
      bioavailability and tolerability of the test and reference formulations in 
      healthy male adult volunteers. This single-dose, randomized, double-blind, 
      two-way crossover trial was conducted at Bestian Medical Center in Bucheon, 
      Korea. In total, 40 male Korean volunteers were enrolled. The subjects were 
      randomized to receive an FDC tablet containing the glimepiride/metformin (2/500 
      mg) test or reference formulation, and pharmacokinetic(PK) parameters were 
      measured. After a 1-week washout period, the other formulation was administered 
      and the PK parameters were measured again. The Cmax and AUCt were determined from 
      blood samples obtained at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, and 24 
      h after drug administration. Bioequivalence was considered established if the 90% 
      CIs of the geometric mean ratios(GMRs) of the test-to-reference formulations for 
      Cmax and AUCt were within the predetermined regulatory range of 80-125%. In 
      total, 40 healthy male subjects were enrolled and completed the study (mean [SD] 
      age, 23.2[2.26]years[range, 19-30years];weight, 68.95[8.30]Kg[range, 52.0-87.0 
      Kg]; and height, 175.4[5.34] cm[range, 164-189 cm]). The GMRs(90% CI) of the 
      glimepiride Cmax and AUCt were 1.006(0.947-1.069) and 1.010(0.953-1.071), 
      respectively. For metformin, the values were 1.019(0.959-1.083) and 
      1.035(0.989-1.084), respectively. The test and reference formulations had similar 
      PK parameters. The test formulation of glimepiride/metformin (2/500 mg) FDC 
      tablets met the Korean regulatory criteria for bioequivalence.

TI  - Enhanced transdermal controlled delivery of glimepiride from the ethylene-vinyl 
      acetate matrix.
PG  - 320-30

AB  - An ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) matrix containing glimepiride was prepared as a 
      potential transdermal drug delivery system. Permeation studies of quinupramine 
      through the EVA copolymer membrane were carried out using a two-chamber diffusion 
      cell. The rate of drug permeation through the EVA membrane was proportional to 
      the PEG 400 volume fraction. The release of glimepiride from the EVA matrix was 
      examined using a modified Franz diffusion cell. A plasticizer was added to 
      prepare the pore structure of the EVA matrix in order to increase the rate of 
      drug release. The effects of PEG 400, drug concentration, temperature, and 
      plasticizer on the drug release rate were investigated. Various types of 
      enhancers were added to an EVA matrix containing 2% glimepiride in an attempt to 
      increase the level of skin permeation of quinupramine through an EVA matrix. The 
      effects of the enhancers on the level of glimepiride permeation through the skin 
      were evaluated using Franz diffusion cells fitted with intact excised rat skin. 
      The rate of drug release from the EVA matrix increased with increasing PEG 400 
      volume fraction, temperature, and drug loading. The estimated activation energy 
      of drug release was 7.274 kcal/mol for 2% drug loading dose. The release of 
      glimepiride from the EVA matrix followed a diffusion-controlled model, where the 
      quantity released per unit area was proportional to the square root of time. The 
      controlled release of glimepiride was achieved using the EVA polymer including 
      the plasticizer. Among the plasticizers used, such as the alkyl citrates and 
      phthalates groups, diethyl phthalate slightly increased the rate of glimepiride 
      release. Among the various enhancers used, such as the non-ionic surfactants, the 
      glycerides, the propylene glycol derivatives, fatty acids (saturated or 
      unsaturated), and pyrrolidones, linoleic acid showed the highest permeation rate; 
      3.17-times higher than the control. In conclusion, an EVA matrix containing a 
      permeation enhancer can be used for the transdermal controlled delivery of 
      glimepiride.

TI  - Eudragit-based nanosuspension of poorly water-soluble drug: formulation and in 
      vitro-in vivo evaluation.
PG  - 1031-44
LID - 10.1208/s12249-012-9833-0 [doi]
AB  - The present study was performed to investigate potential of Eudragit RLPO-based 
      nanosuspension of glimepiride (Biopharmaceutical Classification System class II 
      drug), for the improvement of its solubility and overall therapeutic efficacy, 
      suitable for peroral administration. Nanoprecipitation method being simple and 
      less sophisticated was optimized for the preparation of nanosuspension. 
      Physicochemical characteristics of nanosuspension in terms of size, zeta 
      potential, polydispersity index, entrapment efficiency (% EE) and in vitro drug 
      release were found within their acceptable ranges. The size of the nanoparticles 
      was most strongly affected by agitation time while % EE was more influenced by 
      the drug/polymer ratio. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction 
      studies provided evidence that enhancement in solubility of drug resulted due to 
      change in crystallinity of drug within the formulation. Stability study revealed 
      that nanosuspension was more stable at refrigerated condition with no significant 
      changes in particle size distribution, % EE, and release characteristics for 
      3 months. In vivo studies were performed on nicotinamide-streptozotocin-induced 
      diabetic rat models for pharmacokinetic and antihyperglycaemic activity. 
      Nanosuspension increased maximum plasma concentration, area under the curve, and 
      mean residence time values significantly as compared to aqueous suspension. Oral 
      glucose tolerance test and antihyperglycaemic studies demonstrated plasma glucose 
      levels were efficiently controlled in case of nanosuspension than glimepiride 
      suspension. Briefly, sustained and prolonged activity of nanosuspensions could 
      reduce dose frequency, decrease drug side effects, and improve patient 
      compliance. Therefore, glimepiride nanosuspensions can be expected to gain 
      considerable attention in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus due to its 
      improved therapeutic activity.

AB  - Novel carboxymethyl fenugreek galactomannan (CFG)-gellan gum (GG)-calcium 
      silicate (CS) composite beads were developed for controlled glimepiride (GLI) 
      delivery. CFG having degree of carboxymethylation of 0.71 was synthesized and 
      characterized by FTIR, DSC and XRD analyses. Subsequently, GLI-loaded hybrids 
      were accomplished by ionotropic gelation technique employing Ca(+2)/Zn(+2)/Al(+3) 
      ions as cross-linkers. All the formulations demonstrated excellent drug 
      encapsulation efficiency (DEE, 48-97%) and sustained drug release behaviour 
      (Q(8h), 62-94%). These quality attributes were remarkably influenced by 
      polymer-blend (GG:CFG) ratios, cross-linker types and CS inclusion. The drug 
      release profile of the optimized formulation (F-6) was best fitted in zero-order 
      model with anomalous diffusion driven mechanism. It also conferred excellent ex 
      vivo mucoadhesive property and considerable hypoglycemic effect in 
      streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Furthermore, the beads were characterized 
      for drug-excipients compatibility, drug crystallinity, thermal behaviour and 
      surface morphology. Thus, the developed hybrid matrices are appropriate for 
      controlled delivery of GLI for Type 2 diabetes management.

TI  - A toxicology study to evaluate the embryotoxicity of metformin compared with the 
      hypoglycemic drugs, the anticancer drug, the anti-epileptic drug, the antibiotic, 
      and the cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The safe use of medications in pregnant females, their embryos and in 
      offspring is important. The aim of the present study was to evaluate 
      embryotoxicity of metformin (MET) compared with other hypoglycemic drugs 
      (rosiglitazone [RSG] and glimepiride [GLIM]), the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil 
      (5-FU), the anti-epileptic drug diphenylhydantoin (DPH), the antibiotic 
      penicillin G (PenG), and the cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor nimesulide (NIM) 
      in an embryonic stem cell test (EST). METHODS: Differences in the expression of 
      developmental marker genes following treatment with the test compounds during the 
      course of differentiation (from embryonic stem cell D3 (D3 cells) to myocardial 
      cells) were determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In 
      these studies, 5-FU was used as a positive control and PenG was used as a 
      negative control. The cytotoxicity of these drugs against D3 cells and 3T3 
      fibroblasts was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2 
      thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Embryotoxicity was 
      classified according to the prediction model of EST. RESULTS: At concentrations 
      >800 μg/mL MET had a greater cytotoxic effect on D3 cells than 3T3 fibroblasts. 
      At the highest concentration of MET (5 mg/mL), the cell viability of D3 cells and 
      3T3 fibroblasts was <10% and >30%, respectively. The size of the embryonic body 
      (EB) differentiation area was almost the same over the concentration range 
      50-200 μg/mL MET, and there was no significant difference in EB differentiation 
      area until a concentration of 400 μg/mL MET. At a concentration of 800 μg/mL MET, 
      the size of EB outgrowth was significantly reduced. The same assays revealed 
      GLIM, RSG, and NIM to be weakly embryotoxic substances. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the 
      EST, MET can be classified as a weakly embryotoxic substance, which suggests that 
      it should be prescribed with caution to pregnant women with gestational diabetes.

      positive mode.
PG  - 1900-1907
LID - 10.1002/bmc.3760 [doi]
AB  - A sensitive LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for quantitation of 
      saroglitazar using turboion spray interface with positive ion mode. A 
      liquid-liquid extraction, with a mixture of dichloromethane and diethyl ether, 
      was employed for the extraction of saroglitazar and glimepiride (IS) from human 
      plasma. The chromatographic separation was achieved using an ACE-5, C(18) 
      (4.6 × 100 mm) column with a gradient mobile phase comprising acetonitrile and 
      ammonium acetate buffer with trifluoracetic acid in purified water. Both analytes 
      were separated within 10 min with retention times of 4.52 and 2.57 min for 
      saroglitazar and IS, respectively. Saroglitazar quantitation was achieved by the 
      summation of two MRM transition pairs (m/z 440.2 to m/z 366.0 and m/z 440.2 to 
      m/z 183.1), while that of IS was achieved using transition pair m/z 491.3 to m/z 
      352.0. The calibration standards of saroglitazar showed linearity from 0.2 to 
      500 ng/mL, with a lower limit of quantitation of 0.2 ng/mL. The biases for inter- 
      and intra-batch assays were -7.51-1.15% and -11.21 to -3.25%, respectively, while 
      the corresponding precisions were 5.04-8.06% and 1.53-7.68%, respectively. The 
      developed method was used to monitor the plasma concentrations of saroglitazar in 
      clinical samples.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Implementation of a new pharmaceutical technique to improve aqueous 
      solubility and thus dissolution, enhancement of drug permeation, and finally 
      formulation of a controlled release tablet loaded with glimepiride (GLMP). 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Improve GLMP bioavailability and pharmacokinetics in type II 
      diabetic patients. METHODS: Different polymers were used to enhance aqueous GLMP 
      solubility of which a saturated polymeric drug solution was prepared and 
      physically adsorbed onto silica. An experimental design was employed to optimize 
      the formulation parameters affecting the preparation of GLMP matrix tablets. A 
      compatibility study was conducted to study components interactions. Scanning 
      electron microscope (SEM) was performed before and after the tablets were placed 
      in the dissolution medium. An in vivo study in human volunteers was performed 
      with the optimized GLMP tablets, which were compared to pure and marketed drug 
      products. RESULTS: Enhancement of GLMP aqueous solubility, using the polymeric 
      drug solution technique, by more than 6-7 times when compared with the binary 
      system. All the studied formulation factors significantly affected the studied 
      variables. No significant interaction was detected among components. SEM 
      illustrated the surface and inner tablet structure, and confirmed the drug 
      release which was attributed to diffusion mechanism. The volunteer group 
      administered the optimized GLMP tablet exhibited higher drug plasma concentration 
      (147.4 ng/mL), longer time to reach maximum plasma concentration (4 h) and longer 
      t(1/2) (7.236 h) compared to other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Matrix tablet loaded with 
      a physically modified drug form could represent a key solution for drugs with 
      inconsistent dissolution and absorption profiles.

TI  - Effect of ranolazine on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes 
      treated with either glimepiride or metformin.
PG  - 463-74
LID - 10.1111/dom.12629 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To report the results of two phase III trials assessing the efficacy of 
      ranolazine for glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes on metformin or 
      glimepiride background therapy. METHODS: In two double-blind trials we randomized 
      431 and 442 patients with type 2 diabetes to ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily 
      versus placebo added to either glimepiride (glimepiride add-on study) or 
      metformin background therapy (metformin add-on study). Patients receiving 
      ranolazine added to metformin had their metformin dose halved (with the addition 
      of a metformin-matched placebo) relative to the placebo group to correct for a 
      metformin-ranolazine pharmacokinetic interaction. The primary endpoint of the 
      trials was the change from baseline in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at week 24. 
      RESULTS: When added to glimepiride, ranolazine caused a 0.51% least squares mean 
      [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71, 0.32] decrease from baseline in HbA1c at 
      24 weeks relative to placebo and roughly doubled the proportion of patients 
      achieving an HbA1c of <7% (27.1 vs 14.1%; p = 0.001). When added to metformin 
      background therapy, there was no significant difference in the 24-week HbA1c 
      change from baseline [placebo-corrected LS mean difference -0.11% (95% CI -0.31, 
      0.1)]. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, addition of ranolazine in patients 
      with type 2 diabetes treated with glimepiride, but not metformin, significantly 
      reduced HbA1c over 24 weeks. The decreased dose of metformin used in the 
      metformin add-on study complicates the interpretation of this trial. Whether an 
      effective regimen of ranolazine added to metformin for glycaemic control can be 
      identified remains unclear.

TI  - Add-on therapies to metformin in type 2 diabetes: what modulates the respective 
      decrements in postprandial and basal glucose?
PG  - 943-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) are usually divided into postprandial 
      and basal drugs. As their actions are probably more complex, it is important to 
      ascertain which factors can modulate their effects. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 
      Thirty-one type 2 diabetes patients treated with metformin (glycosylated 
      hemoglobin [HbA1c] 6.5-9%; median, 7.3%) and enrolled in two randomized 
      controlled studies were allocated to either rosiglitazone (Group 1, n = 8) or 
      glimepiride (Group 2, n = 7) and to either vildagliptin or sitagliptin (Group 3 
      considered as a whole, n = 16). All patients were investigated using continuous 
      glucose monitoring at baseline and after 8-12 weeks of add-on therapy. Areas 
      under the 24-h glycemic profile curves (AUCs) were determined for assessing 
      postprandial (AUCpp), basal (AUCb), and total (AUCtotal) hyperglycemia. After 
      calculation of decrements in AUCs (∂AUCs) from baseline to end of treatment 
      periods, the following contribution ratios of postprandial and basal decrements 
      to the overall glucose decrement were determined: ∂AUCpp/∂AUCtotal and 
      ∂AUCb/∂AUCtotal (%). RESULTS: ∂AUCpp/∂AUCtotal and ∂AUCb/∂AUCtotal were 
      negatively and positively, respectively, associated (R(2) = 0.195, P = 0.013) 
      with baseline HbA1c. ∂AUCpp/∂AUCtotal was significantly higher (50.8 ± 4.8%) in 
      patients with HbA1c <7.3% than in those with HbA1c ≥ 7.3% (27.0 ± 4.4%) (P = 
      0.001). After adjustment on baseline HbA1c, ∂AUCpp/∂AUCtotal was greater in Group 
      3 (44.0 ± 1.6%) than in Group 1 (32.1 ± 4%) and 2 (37.0 ± 3.1%) (P = 0.007). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Gliptins, glitazones and sulfonylureas concomitantly act on basal 
      and postprandial glucose even though gliptins are more efficient on postprandial 
      glucose. HbA1c appears as a reliable factor for predicting the respective 
      decrements of these two parameters and thus for guiding the choice between the 
      aforementioned drugs.

TI  - Appropriate timing of glimepiride administration in patients with type 2 diabetes 
      millitus: a study in Mediterranean countries.
PG  - 117-21
AB  - Sulfonylureas are used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when diet 
      and exercise fail. Glimepiride, a new sulfonylurea, can be administered in one 
      daily dose, thanks to its pharmacokinetic properties. We attempted to establish 
      the optimal time of day for the administration of Glimepiride in a group of 
      patients from the Mediterranean area by clinical trial. No relationship was found 
      between the time of administration and fasting blood glucose values, or HbA1c, or 
      the frequency or severity of hypoglycemic episodes.

TI  - Determination of glimepiride in human plasma using semi-microbore high 
      performance liquid chromatography with column-switching.
PG  - 143-9
AB  - A fully automated semi-microbore high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) 
      method with column-switching using UV detection was developed for the 
      determination of glimepiride from human plasma samples. Plasma sample (900 
      microl) was deproteinated and extracted with ethanol and acetonitrile. The 
      extract (70 microl) was directly injected into a Capcell Pak MF Ph-1 pre-column 
      where the primary separation occurred to remove proteins and retain drugs using a 
      mixture of acetonitrile and 10mM phosphate buffer (pH 2.18) (20:80, v/v). The 
      analytes were transferred from the pre-column to an intermediate column using a 
      switching valve and then subsequently separated on an analytical column and 
      monitored with UV detection at 228 nm. Glimepiride was eluted with retention time 
      34.9 min without interference of endogenous substance from plasma. The limit of 
      quantification (LOQ) was 10 ng/ml for glimepiride. The calibration curves were 
      linear over the concentration range of 10-400 ng/ml (r(2) = 0.9997). Moreover, 
      inter- and intra-day precisions of the method were less than 15% and accuracies 
      were higher than 99%. The developed method was successfully applied for the 
      quantification of glimepiride in human plasma and was used to support a human 
      pharmacokinetic study following a single oral administration of 2 mg glimepiride.

AB  - Glimepiride (GMD) is a third-generation sulfonylurea derivative and one of the 
      top three most-prescribed oral antidiabetic drugs. The need for a depot 
      formulation exists, and a safe and effective antidiabetic therapy is the goal of 
      this study. The aims were to design a depot in situ gel (ISG) formulation and 
      investigate the main factors that control the initial burst and sustain the GMD 
      effect using the Box-Behnken design. The studied factors were polymer percent 
      (X(1)), plasticizer percent (X(2)) and benzyl benzoate percent in 
      N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (X(3)). The results revealed that X(2) is the only factor 
      that showed significant effects on all investigated responses. Scanning electron 
      microscopy images showed that an increase in PEG % improved the smoothness and 
      reduced the porosity of the ISG formulation surface. The GMD plasma levels in 
      diabetic rats revealed no significant difference (p < 0.05) between the maximum 
      GMD plasma concentrations of the optimized GMD-ISG formula (10 mg/ kg) and oral 
      marketed GMD tablets (1 mg/kg). This result ensures that the optimized formula 
      does not exceed the maximum safe plasma concentration. In addition, the optimized 
      GMD-ISG formulation showed a depot effect that lasted for 14 days post-injection. 
      This approach to controlling GMD release using an in situ forming system could be 
      useful for improving patient compliance and diabetes treatment effectiveness.

TI  - Repaglinide : a pharmacoeconomic review of its use in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 389-411
AB  - Repaglinide (Prandin), NovoNorm, GlucoNorm, an oral insulin secretagogue, was the 
      first meglitinide analogue to become available for use in patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus. The drug lowers postprandial glucose excursions by targeting 
      early-phase insulin release, an effect thought to be important in reducing 
      long-term cardiovascular complications of diabetes. Repaglinide provided similar 
      overall glycaemic control to that achieved with glibenclamide (glyburide), as 
      assessed by glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and fasting blood glucose levels, 
      and was generally well tolerated in well designed clinical trials. Its rapid 
      onset and relatively short duration of action allow for flexible meal schedules. 
      Two modelled US cost-effectiveness analyses projected lifetime costs and outcomes 
      for a hypothetical cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes. Both analyses 
      projected long-term complications using data on HbA(1c) level changes from 
      short-term clinical trials. Repaglinide plus rosiglitazone was dominant over 
      rosiglitazone in one analysis, and repaglinide plus metformin was dominant over 
      nateglinide plus metformin in the other. A similar Canadian analysis showed a 
      favourable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (<dollars US 1000 per QALY 
      gained; 2001 values) for patients who switched from a sulphonylurea to 
      repaglinide versus those who remained on sulphonylurea therapy. Long-term 
      outcomes were projected using short-term clinical trial data on postprandial 
      blood glucose level changes in the Canadian study. All three cost-effectiveness 
      analyses are available as abstracts/posters. Two US cost analyses (both published 
      in full) have also been conducted comparing the short-term costs (<or=3 years) of 
      repaglinide, with or without metformin, versus other oral antidiabetic regimens. 
      Results of these analyses are somewhat equivocal because of study design issues 
      and/or a lack of statistically significant differences between treatment groups. 
      In conclusion, repaglinide as monotherapy or in combination with other 
      antidiabetic agents, such as metformin or rosiglitazone, achieves good metabolic 
      control, similar to that achieved with comparable glibenclamide regimens. Severe 
      hypoglycaemic episodes are less common with repaglinide than some sulphonylureas, 
      including glibenclamide. Modelled cost-effectiveness analyses conducted in North 
      America showed favourable results for repaglinide-containing regimens versus 
      comparators, largely attributed to projected reductions in long-term 
      cardiovascular complications using short-term data on changes in glycaemic 
      parameters from clinical trials. Results of these cost-effectiveness analyses 
      (all of which have been published as abstracts/posters) should be interpreted 
      with caution since various assumptions regarding long-term costs and outcomes 
      were necessarily incorporated into the economic models. While repaglinide is a 
      useful addition to the available treatment options in type 2 diabetes, potential 
      long-term advantages versus other agents, such as reducing cardiovascular 
      complications, require confirmation. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is 
      projected to increase to over 3% of the world's population ( approximate, equals 
      220 million people) by the year 2010. Globally, 97% of patients with diabetes 
      have type 2 disease, although in industrialised countries the proportion of type 
      2 disease is about 90%. In 2010, an estimated 14.85 million individuals in the US 
      and 2.88 million in the UK will be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. In addition, 
      approximately one-third to one-half of individuals with diabetes are unaware that 
      they have the disease, and are therefore undiagnosed. Diabetes is associated with 
      significant morbidity, mortality and economic consequences. For the year 2002 in 
      the US, direct medical costs associated with diabetes (type 1 and 2) were 
      estimated at dollars US 91.8 billion (70% of total costs) and indirect costs at 
      dollars US 39.8 billion (30%), for a total of dollars US 132 billion. Data from 
      more than 7000 patients in eight European countries indicate tha the mean cost 
      per patient with diabetes was dollars US 2928 annually (1999 values), and the 
      proportion of total healthcare expenditure directed toward diabetes ranged from 
      1.6% to 6.6% depending on the country. Several analyses focusing specifically on 
      type 2 disease showed, not surprisingly, that costs were higher among patients 
      with diabetic complications than in those without complications. Repaglinide, a 
      meglitinide analogue, is an oral insulin secretagogue that reduces postprandial 
      glucose excursions by targeting postprandial insulin release. In clinical trials 
      in patients with type 2 diabetes, repaglinide was usually administered at a 
      dosage of 0.5-4 mg three times daily before meals as monotherapy or in 
      combination with other agents. In placebo-controlled trials of up to 24 weeks' 
      duration in patients with type 2 diabetes, repaglinide achieved statistically 
      significant improvements in glycaemic control, as assessed by glycosylated 
      haemoglobin (HbA(1c)), fasting blood glucose (FBG) and/or postprandial blood 
      glucose (PPBG) levels compared with placebo. Preprandial administration of 
      repaglinide achieved similar glycaemic control to glibenclamide (glyburide) 
      1.75-15 mg/day and better glycaemic control than glipizide 5-15 mg/day in 1-year, 
      double-blind, randomised trials in patients with type 2 disease, the vast 
      majority of whom had previously received oral antidiabetic therapy. Several 
      randomised, open-label studies have evaluated repaglinide as part of combination 
      therapy over 3-6 months in patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate 
      glycaemic control with previous drug therapy. In general, results showed 
      statistically significant improvements in glycaemic control when repaglinide was 
      used in combination with metformin, various thiazolidinediones, or metformin plus 
      bedtime insulin compared with monotherapy with either comparator drug in each 
      study (or metformin plus bedtime insulin in one trial). Other studies in this 
      patient population indicate that metformin plus repaglinide is associated with 
      significantly better glycaemic control than metformin plus nateglinide 60-120 mg 
      three times daily over 16 weeks, and similar glycaemic control to that achieved 
      with metformin in combination with either glibenclamide or glimepiride for up to 
      1 year. Good glycaemic control has also been achieved with preprandial 
      administration of repaglinide in flexible meal schedules. This was demonstrated 
      in a placebo-controlled trial and in a large, prospective survey of patients 
      receiving repaglinide in a clinical setting. The tolerability profile of 
      repaglinide is characterised by adverse events of mild-to-moderate intensity 
      similar to those associated with sulphonylureas. The most frequently reported 
      adverse events with repaglinide include hypoglycaemia, upper respiratory 
      infection, headache, other respiratory events, musculoskeletal events and 
      gastrointestinal events. Severe episodes of hypoglycaemia are rare with 
      repaglinide and occur approximately 2-2.5 times less frequently than with 
      sulphonylureas. In addition, available data indicate that repaglinide may be less 
      likely to increase bodyweight than various commonly used sulphonylurea agents. In 
      general, repaglinide is also well tolerated when used as part of combination 
      therapy. Repaglinide is metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 enzyme 
      system and therefore has the potential to interact with other CYP3A4 substrates 
      when administered concurrently. A number of studies in healthy volunteers have 
      shown no clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions when 
      repaglinide was administered concomitantly with digoxin, theophylline, warfarin, 
      cimetidine, ketoconazole, rifampicin (rifampin), ethinylestradiol, simvastatin or 
      nifedipine. However, a clinically significant increase in systemic exposure to 
      repaglinide occurs when clarithromycin and repaglinide are administered 
      concurrently, which may necessitate a reduction in repaglinide dosage. Moreover, 
      a potentially hazardous interaction occurs when gemfibrozil (alone or with 
      itraconazole) is used concomitantly with repaglinide. In view of the marked 
      increase in systemic exposure to repaglinide, the combination of repaglinide and 
      gemfibrozil should be avoided if possible. Pharmacoeconomic Analyses of 
      RepaglinideTwo US cost analyses have been conducted with repaglinide in patients 
      with type 2 diabetes (both published in full). One was a retrospective analysis 
      of pharmacy and medical claims data from a large managed care organisation in 
      which costs were adjusted for age, gender and comorbidities. Total adjusted (year 
      2000) cost per patient over a 9-month period was numerically lower for those 
      treated with a combination of repaglinide plus metformin (dollars US 8924) than 
      for patients who received metformin only (dollars US 9448), metformin plus 
      glibenclamide (dollars US 9576) or repaglinide only (dollars US 11910), although 
      there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups. The 
      other study, a literature-based decision-tree analysis, projected the proportion 
      of patients achieving a target HbA(1c) level (<7%) and the associated direct 
      medical costs over a 3-year period from the time of diagnosis. Among six 
      different treatment regimens evaluated, costs ranged from dollars US 6106 with 
      glipizide gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) to dollars US 9298 with 
      repaglinide monotherapy (2001/2002 values). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
      indicated that first-line therapy with glipizide GITS or metformin would be 
      associated with lower total medical costs than rosiglitazone or repaglinide 
      monotherapy. Three cost-effectiveness analyses, all of which are modelled studies 
      published as abstracts and/or posters, have been conducted with repaglinide in 
      patients with type 2 diabetes. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

TI  - Linagliptin (BI 1356), a potent and selective DPP-4 inhibitor, is safe and 
      efficacious in combination with metformin in patients with inadequately 
      controlled Type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 1409-19

AB  - AIMS: The efficacy and safety of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, 
      linagliptin, added to ongoing metformin therapy, were assessed in patients with 
      Type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control (HbA(1c) ≥ 7.5 to ≤ 10%; ≥ 
      58.5 to ≤ 85.8 mmol/mol) with metformin alone. METHODS: Patients (n=333) were 
      randomized to receive double-blind linagliptin (1, 5 or 10 mg once daily) or 
      placebo or open-label glimepiride (1-3 mg once daily). The primary outcome 
      measure was the change from baseline in HbA(1c) at week 12 in patients receiving 
      combination therapy compared with metformin alone. RESULTS: Twelve weeks of 
      treatment resulted in a mean (sem) placebo-corrected lowering in HbA(1c) levels 
      of 0.40% (± 0.14); 4.4 mmol/mol (± 1.5) for 1 mg linagliptin, 0.73% (± 0.14); 8.0 
      mmol/mol (± 1.5) for 5 mg, and 0.67% (± 0.14); 7.3 mmol/mol (± 1.5) for 10 mg. 
      Differences between linagliptin and placebo were statistically significant for 
      all doses (1 mg, P = 0.01; 5 mg and 10 mg, P < 0.0001). The change in mean (sem) 
      placebo-corrected HbA(1c) from baseline was -0.90% (± 0.13); -9.8 mmol/mol (± 
      1.4) for glimepiride. Adjusted and placebo-corrected mean changes in fasting 
      plasma glucose were -1.1 mmol/l for linagliptin 1 mg (P = 0.002), -1.9 mmol/l for 
      5 mg and -1.6 mmol/l for 10 mg (both P < 0.0001). One hundred and six (43.1%) 
      patients reported adverse events; the incidence was similar across all five 
      groups. There were no hypoglycaemic events for linagliptin or placebo, whereas 
      three patients (5%) receiving glimepiride experienced hypoglycaemia. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The addition of linagliptin to ongoing metformin treatment in patients with Type 
      2 diabetes was well tolerated and resulted in significant and clinically relevant 
      improvements in glycaemic control, with 5 mg linagliptin being the most effective 
      dose.

TI  - Determination of glimepiride in human plasma by liquid 
      chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.
PG  - 103-9
AB  - A sensitive and specific high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray 
      ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS-MS) method has been developed at 
      our center for the determination of glimepiride in human plasma. After the 
      addition of the internal standard, plasma samples were extracted by liquid-liquid 
      extraction technique using diethyl ether. The compounds were separated on a 
      prepacked C18 column using a mixture of acetonitrile, methanol and ammonium 
      acetate buffer as mobile phase. A Finnigan LCQDUO ion trap mass spectrometer 
      connected to an Alliance Waters HPLC was used to develop and validate the method. 
      The analytical method was validated according to the FDA bioanalytical method 
      validation guidance. The results were within the accepted criteria as stated in 
      the aforementioned guidance. The method was proved to be sensitive and specific 
      by testing six different plasma batches. Linearity was established for the range 
      of concentrations 5.0-500.0 ng/ml with a coefficient of determination (r2) of 
      0.9998. Accuracy for glimepiride ranged from 100.58 to 104.48% at low, mid and 
      high levels. The intra-day precision was better than 12.24%. The lower limit of 
      quantitation (LLOQ) was identifiable and reproducible at 5.0 ng/ml with a 
      precision of 7.96%. The proposed method enables the unambiguous identification 
      and quantitation of glimepiride for pharmacokinetic, bioavailability or 
      bioequivalence studies.

TI  - Outcomes Associated with Generic Drugs Approved Using Product-Specific 
      Determinations of Therapeutic Equivalence.
PG  - 427-433
LID - 10.1007/s40265-017-0696-2 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine rates of clinical outcomes among patients before 
      and after market introduction of generic versions of five drugs approved using 
      product-specific equivalence determinations. METHODS: We used data from a large 
      national insurer to identify patients who initiated a study (acarbose tablets, 
      salmon calcitonin nasal spray, enoxaparin injection, vancomycin capsules, 
      venlafaxine extended-release tablets) or control drug (nateglinide, glimepiride, 
      alendronate, fondaparinux, metronidazole, sertraline, paroxetine) in each 
      calendar month between 2003 and 2012 and to determine rates of claims-based 
      proxies for lack of effectiveness outcomes following initiation. We used 
      segmented time-series analyses to evaluate level (short-term) and slope 
      (longer-term) changes in outcomes upon introduction of a generic study or control 
      drug. RESULTS: Among study drugs, we observed three increases (one with p < 0.05) 
      and three decreases (two with p < 0.05) in the level of outcome rates. All 
      changes in slope indicated decreases in outcomes from the brand-only to the 
      generic period; four had p < 0.05. For control drugs, we observed positive level 
      changes for eight of nine drug-outcome pairs; two had p < 0.05. We observed 
      negative slope changes for eight out of nine pairs; six had p < 0.05. We observed 
      a significant increase in level change following the introduction of generic 
      bupropion versions that were later found to be not bioequivalent (p < 0.01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: We did not find evidence that introduction of generic drugs approved 
      using product-specific therapeutic equivalence determinations was associated with 
      worse clinical outcomes than those among initiators of the brand-name versions of 
      the same products. We observed similar patterns for control drugs.

TI  - The newly developed sulfonylurea glimepiride: a new ingredient, an old recipe.
PG  - 179-86
AB  - Disturbances in insulin secretion and insulin action are both involved in the 
      pathophysiology of type 2 (or non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. The newly 
      developed sulfonylurea (SU) derivative glimepiride has a marked insulin secretory 
      effect both in vitro and in vivo, and is capable of increasing plasma insulin 
      levels with approximately 50% in type 2 diabetes subjects. Glimepiride improves 
      metabolic control comparable but not superior to other (second generation) SU 
      derivatives. Although it has been advocated for once-daily use, maximum effect is 
      presumably achieved by twice-daily dosing. One of the most important side-effects 
      of SU remains hypoglycemia in some patients, which may last for several hours. 
      Although there is some indication that the use of glimepiride leads to fewer 
      hypoglycemic episodes than glibenclamide, the differences reported sofar are not 
      statistically significant.

TI  - Pharmacogenomic analysis of ATP-sensitive potassium channels coexpressing the 
      common type 2 diabetes risk variants E23K and S1369A.
PG  - 206-14
LID - 10.1097/FPC.0b013e32835001e7 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The common ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel variants E23K and 
      S1369A, found in the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes, respectively, form a haplotype that 
      is associated with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes. Our previous studies 
      showed that KATP channel inhibition by the A-site sulfonylurea gliclazide was 
      increased in the K23/A1369 haplotype. Therefore, we studied the pharmacogenomics 
      of seven clinically used sulfonylureas and glinides to determine their 
      structure-activity relationships in KATP channels containing either the E23/S1369 
      nonrisk or K23/A1369 risk haplotypes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The 
      patch-clamp technique was used to determine sulfonylurea and glinide inhibition 
      of recombinant human KATP channels containing either the E23/S1369 or the 
      K23/A1369 haplotype. RESULTS: KATP channels containing the K23/A1369 risk 
      haplotype were significantly less sensitive to inhibition by tolbutamide, 
      chlorpropamide, and glimepiride (IC50 values for K23/A1369 vs. E23/S1369=1.15 vs. 
      0.71 μmol/l; 4.19 vs. 3.04 μmol/l; 4.38 vs. 2.41 nmol/l, respectively). In 
      contrast, KATP channels containing the K23/A1369 haplotype were significantly 
      more sensitive to inhibition by mitiglinide (IC50=9.73 vs. 28.19 nmol/l for 
      K23/A1369 vs. E23/S1369) and gliclazide. Nateglinide, glipizide, and 
      glibenclamide showed similar inhibitory profiles in KATP channels containing 
      either haplotype. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the ring-fused pyrrole 
      moiety in several A-site drugs likely underlies the observed inhibitory potency 
      of these drugs on KATP channels containing the K23/A1369 risk haplotype. It may 
      therefore be possible to tailor existing therapy or design novel drugs that 
      display an increased efficacy in type 2 diabetes patients homozygous for these 
      common KATP channel haplotypes.

TI  - Usage pattern, glycemic improvement, hypoglycemia, and body mass index changes 
      with sulfonylureas in real-life clinical practice: results from OBSTACLE 
      Hypoglycemia Study.
PG  - 129-35
LID - 10.1089/dia.2012.0237 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individual sulfonylurea agents differ in pharmacokinetic properties 
      and clinical effects. This study aimed to describe the usage pattern, glycemic 
      improvement, hypoglycemia, and change in body mass index (BMI) observed with 
      commonly used sulfonylureas. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patients of either gender with 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), between 18 and 75 years old and requiring 
      addition of a sulfonylurea to an ongoing regimen of oral antihyperglycemic 
      agent(s), were enrolled. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and BMI were assessed at 
      both baseline and the end of 12 weeks of follow-up. The hypoglycemia score was 
      assessed at the end of follow-up only. RESULTS: In total, 1,069 patients were 
      enrolled in the study, of whom 950 were considered evaluable. After a mean 
      follow-up of 14.34±2.80 weeks, the HbA1c level decreased by 0.86±2.28%, BMI 
      increased by 0.13±0.78 kg/m2, and mean hypoglycemia score was 0.98±1.42. A weak 
      negative, statistically significant correlation (r = -0.093; P=0.0044) between 
      hypoglycemic scores and increase in BMI was observed. No correlation was observed 
      between change in HbA1c level and change in BMI. Glimepiride was the most 
      commonly prescribed sulfonylurea (75.3%). For patients on glimepiride, a weak 
      positive, statistically significant correlation (r=0.098; P=0.0082) between its 
      dose and the hypoglycemic score was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Various sulfonylurea 
      agents appear to differ in their effect on glycemic control, tendency to cause 
      hypoglycemia, and gain in BMI. Hypoglycemia caused by these agents appears not 
      only to be dose related, but also correlates inversely with gain in BMI.

TI  - Interaction of mouse intestinal P-glycoprotein with oral antidiabetic drugs and 
      its inhibitors.
PG  - 611-6
AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a progressive insulin secretory defect accompanied by 
      resistance to insulin, and thereby making glycemic control a major concern in the 
      treatment of these patients. Oral drug administration, though a popular option 
      for its non-invasiveness, suffer from poor bioavailability. It could be related 
      to the efflux transport of intestinal P-glycoprotein (Pgp). In the present study, 
      we explored the binding interactions of antidiabetic drugs i.e., sulfonylurea 
      drugs (glimepiride, glipizide, glyburide) and rapid acting insulin secretagogues 
      viz., nateglinide, repaglinide and rosiglitazone; and Pgp inhibitors i.e., 
      Generation I (verapamil and tamoxifen), III (tetradrine and tariquidar), and 
      natural inhibitors (fumagillin and piperine) in mouse Pgp model. Our results 
      revealed that fumagillin piperine and verapamil possess maximum interaction 
      energies with Pgp compared to antidiabetic drugs. These observations elucidate 
      the role of fumagillin and piperine as potential natural compounds which could 
      intervene in the efflux action of Pgp in extruding the antidiabetic drugs and may 
      have implications for increasing efficacy of oral antidiabetic therapy.

TI  - Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry validated method for the 
      estimation of indapamide in human whole blood.
PG  - 149-54
AB  - A highly precise and sensitive method for the estimation of indapamide in human 
      whole blood using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS) is described. The method developed is validated in human whole-blood 
      matrix, with a sensitivity of 0.5 ng/ml as lower limit of quantification. The 
      procedure for the extraction of indapamide and glimepiride as internal standard 
      (IS) involves haemolysis and deprotienation of whole blood using ZnSO(4) followed 
      by liquid-liquid extraction using ethyl acetate. The sample extracts after drying 
      were reconstituted and analysed by LC-MS/MS, equipped with turbo ion spray (TIS) 
      source, operating in the positive ion and selective reaction monitoring (SRM) 
      acquisition mode to quantify indapamide in human whole blood. The mean recovery 
      for indapamide was 82.40 and 93.23% for IS. The total run time was 2.5 min to 
      monitor both indapamide and the IS. The response of the LC-MS/MS method for 
      indapamide was linear over the range of 0.5-80.0 ng/ml with correlation 
      coefficient, r>or=0.9991. The coefficient of variance (% CV) at 0.5 ng/ml was 
      4.02% and the accuracy was well within the accepted limit of +/-20% at 0.5 ng/ml 
      and +/-15% at all other concentrations in the linear range. This method is fully 
      validated for the accuracy, precision and stability studies and also applied to 
      subject-sample analysis of bioequivalence study for 1.5mg sustained-release (SR) 
      formulations.

TI  - Severe sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia: a problem of uncritical prescription 
      and deficiencies of diabetes care in geriatric patients.
PG  - 675-81
LID - 10.1517/14740338.2010.492777 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Severe sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia (SH) remains a 
      life-threatening and under-reported condition. We investigated the incidence of 
      SH and clinical characteristics of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
      to demonstrate typical risk constellations. METHODS: In a prospective 
      population-based observational study, all consecutive cases of SH in the period 
      2000 - 2009 in a German area with 200,000 inhabitants were registered. Severe 
      hypoglycemia was defined as a symptomatic event requiring treatment with 
      intravenous glucose and was confirmed by a blood glucose measurement of < 50 
      mg/dl. RESULTS: A mean incidence of seven episodes of SH per year and 100,000 
      inhabitants was registered. The 139 hypoglycemic individuals had been treated 
      with glimepiride (n = 98), glibenclamide (n = 40) or gliquidone (n = 1). No 
      preparation showed a constant dose-effect relationship, SH occurring within a 
      wide dose range. The patients were characterized as follows: age 77.5 + or - 9.4 
      years, duration of diabetes 11 + or - 7 years, body mass index 26.3 + or - 4.9 
      kg/m(2), HbA1c 6.6 + or - 1.3%, creatinine clearance 46 + or - 24 ml/min with 
      renal insufficiency in 73% and co-medication 7 + or - 3 drugs. Two-thirds of all 
      subjects lived independently at home whereas a third were cared for by a home 
      nursing service or received care in nursing homes. In all, 30% had participated 
      in diabetes education programs. In 31%, systematic blood glucose monitoring was 
      performed. CONCLUSIONS: Uncritical prescription of sulfonylureas neglecting 
      crucial contraindications - particularly renal insufficiency - and deficiencies 
      of diabetes care contributed substantially to the risk of SH in the mainly 
      geriatric patients. There is a need for alternative therapeutic concepts that 
      minimize the risk of hypoglycemia in geriatric patients with T2DM.

TI  - Repaglinide has more beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk factors than 
      glimepiride: data from meal-test study.
PG  - 255-60
AB  - Aim our study is to compare the effects of repaglinide vs glimepiride 
      administration on cardiovascular risk factors after meal test. Thus, after 2 
      weeks washout period, a 3-month randomised, cross-over parallel group trial of 
      repaglinide (1 mg x 2/day) vs glimepiride (2 mg/day) in 14 patients with type 2 
      diabetes "naive" on diet treatment was made. Both treatments significantly 
      declined plasma glucose, total-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, 
      PAI-1, PAP levels and increased HDL-cholesterol. Lowering in plasma PAI-1 and PAP 
      levels was significantly greater in repaglinide group. Furthermore, repaglinide 
      administration resulted in a significant decrease in fasting plasma free fatty 
      acids, fibrinogen, thrombin-antithrombin complex and reaction product of 
      malondialdehyde with thiobarbituric acid (TBARS) levels, in absence of 
      significant difference in fasting plasma insulin levels. Decrease in plasma TBARS 
      levels correlated with the decrease in Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (r = 
      0.72; P < 0.003) and free fatty acids concentrations (r = 0.62; P < 0.01). 
      Analysis of the insulin and glucose concentrations throughout the meal test 
      revealed that AUC for glucose (758 +/- 19 vs 780 +/- 28 mg/Lxmin; P = 0.02) was 
      significantly lower after repaglinide than glimepiride administration despite 
      similar AUC for insulin (2327 +/- 269 vs 2148 +/- 292 mU/Lxmin; P = 0.105). At 
      time 120' of meal test, repaglinide vs glimepiride administration was associated 
      with a significant decline in plasma triglycerides, free fatty acids, fibrinogen, 
      Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1, plasmin-alpha(2)-antiplasmin complex, 
      thrombin-antithrombin complex, TBARS levels and increase in plasma 
      HDL-cholesterol levels. In repaglinide group a negative correlation between 
      insulin secretion during 1st phase of meal-test and plasma TBARS levels (r = 
      -0.55; P < 0.03) at time 120' was found. Such correlation was lost after 
      adjusting for changes in postprandial hyperglycaemia (r = -0.48; P < 0.09). In 
      conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that repaglinide is more efficient 
      than glimepiride on controlling for postprandial glucose excursion and may have 
      beneficial effect on reducing cardiovascular risk factors.

TI  - Investigation of an active film coating to prepare new fixed-dose combination 
      tablets for treatment of diabetes.
PG  - 201-8
LID - 10.1016/j.ijpharm.2012.01.057 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the present study was to formulate new fixed-dose combination tablets 
      (FCTs) by coating a glimepiride (GLM) immediate-release (IR) layer on a metformin 
      hydrochloride (MTF) extended-release (ER) core tablet using perforated film 
      coating equipment. Composition of GLM-IR coating suspension for homogeneity was 
      studied and application of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) to determine the 
      end-point of the coating process was also investigated. The final product was 
      administered to healthy male volunteers and its pharmacokinetic parameters were 
      analyzed. GLM-IR coating suspension was prepared with a ratio of SLS to GLM at 
      0.75 for homogeneity. An inert mid-layer was introduced to prevent contact 
      between MTF-ER core tablet and GLM-IR layer, which led to an increased release 
      rate of GLM in pH 7.8 medium. The proportional correlation was confirmed between 
      analytical results of GLM determined by NIRS and those by HPLC-UV. Thus, the 
      end-point of the GLM coating process was determined by NIRS, the fast and 
      non-destructive method. New FCTs were confirmed to be bioequivalent to the 
      marketed product.

LID - 10.1517/17425247.2014.906402 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To optimize and use of glimepiride (GMD)-loaded self-nanoemulsifying 
      delivery systems (SNEDs) for the preparation of transdermal patches. METHODS: 
      Mixture design was utilized to optimize GMD-loaded SNEDs in acidic and aqueous pH 
      media. Optimized GMD-loaded SNEDs were used in the preparation of chitosan 
      (acidic) and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) (aqueous) films. The prepared 
      optimized formulations were investigated for ex vivo skin permeation, for in vivo 
      hypoglycemic activity and for their pharmacokinetic parameters using animal 
      model. RESULTS: The optimized formulations showed flux value of (2.88 and 4.428 
      μg/cm(2)/h) through rat skin for chitosan and HPMC films, respectively. The 
      pattern of GMD release from both formulations was in favor of Higuchi and 
      approaching zero order models. The n values for Korsmeyer-Peppas equation were 
      characteristic of anomalous (non-Fickian) release mechanism. Moreover, HPMC 
      patches have shown significant reductions (p < 0.05) in blood glucose levels; 
      (213.33 ± 15.19) mg/100 ml from the base-line measurement after 12 h of 
      application. CONCLUSIONS: Optimized GMD SNEDs patches were found to improve GMD 
      skin permeability and the essential pharmacokinetic parameters. Further extensive 
      pre/clinical studies are necessary prior to use transdermal GMD as a valuable 
      alternative to peroral dosage forms with improved bioavailability, longer 
      duration of action and more patient convenience.

TI  - Gradient elution mode for the troubleshooting of matrix effect on the 
      determination of G004 in different tissues by LC-MS/MS.
PG  - 53-61
LID - 10.1002/bmc.3239 [doi]
AB  - A steep gradient elution mode was applied to reduce the risk of matrix effect 
      (ME) for the determination of G004, a novel sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drug, in a 
      tissue distribution study by LC-MS/MS. The mass spectra of the total-ion-current 
      chromatograms combined with the post-column infusion traces enabled the 'unseen' 
      interfering species to be directly detected, and ensured that the chromatography 
      conditions and sample preparation method were adequate to overcome the ME. 
      According to this, a steep gradient elution mode was designed to overcome the 
      intense ME from different tissues. The analysis was performed by monitoring the 
      transitions m/z 558.1 → 419.0 for G004 and m/z 489.3 → 364.1 for glimepiride used 
      as the internal standard. Calibration curves recovered over a range from 0.1 to 
      10000 ng/mL for seven different tissues. Sex-related difference was found in the 
      tissue distribution. The drug levels in the tissues of female rats were about two 
      to three times higher than those in male counterparts. The highest level was 
      observed in liver, then in kidney, heart, pancreas, lung and spleen, but no G004 
      was detected in brain. G004 was slowly eliminated from female rats compared with 
      male rats. There was no long-term accumulation of G004 in male or female rat 
      tissues.

TI  - Quantification of galantamine in human plasma by validated liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using glimepride as an internal standard: 
      application to bioavailability studies in 32 healthy Korean subjects.
PG  - 803-9
LID - 10.1093/chromsci/bms074 [doi]
AB  - A simple, rapid and selective liquid chromatography method coupled with tandem 
      mass spectrometry is developed and validated for the quantification of 
      galantamine in human plasma using a commercially available compound, glimepride, 
      as an internal standard (IS). Following simple one-step liquid-liquid extraction 
      by ethyl acetate, the analytes are separated using an isocratic mobile phase 
      consisting of acetonitrile and 0.01M ammonium acetate (95/5, v/v) on a 
      reverse-phase C18 column and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry in the multiple 
      reaction monitoring mode using the transitions of respective (M + H)(+) ions, m/z 
      288.22 → 213.20 and m/z 491.17 → 352.30 for the quantification of galantamine and 
      IS, respectively. The standard calibration curves show good linearity within the 
      range of 4 to 240 ng/mL (r(2) = 0.9996, 1/x(2) weighting). The lower limit of 
      quantification is 4 ng/mL. The retention times of galantamine and IS are 1.1 and 
      0.71 min, which showsthe high throughput potential of the proposed method. In 
      addition, no significant metabolic compounds are found to interfere with the 
      analysis. Acceptable precision and accuracy are obtained for the concentrations 
      over the standard curve range. The validated method is successfully applied for 
      pharmacokinetic and bioequivalence studies of 24 mg of a galantamine hydrobromide 
      capsule in 32 healthy Korean subjects.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which blood sugar (glucose) levels are 
      abnormally high because the body does not produce enough insulin to meet its 
      needs. Post-prandial hyperglycemia (PPHG) is an independent risk factor for the 
      development of macro vascular complications. It is now recognized that 
      normalizing post-prandial blood glucose is more difficult than normalizing 
      fasting glucose. Potassium channels are the most widely distributed type of ion 
      channel and are found in virtually all living organisms. The function of KATP 
      channels is best understood in pancreatic beta cells, the membrane potential of 
      which is responsive to external glucose concentration. Beta cells show a 
      remarkably complex electrical bursting behavior in response to an increase in 
      glucose level. Nateglinide and Glimepiride are a class of insulin secretagog 
      agents that lowers blood glucose levels by stimulating insulin secretion from the 
      pancreas. These compounds interact with the ATP-sensitive potassium (K+ATP) 
      channel in pancreatic beta cells. However, the side effects of these drugs 
      overpass their uses, and the need to identify compounds with less adverse effects 
      is exigent. In our research study, we used the natural compound ellagic acid, 
      which is an already proven anti-carcinogen, anti-mutagen, and anticancer 
      initiator, for its anti-diabetic activity in comparison to the two commercial 
      drugs (Nateglinide and Glimepiride). The drugs and the compounds were docked to 
      the ATP-dependent potassium channel and their energy value showed that the 
      compound had higher binding value than the commercial drugs. Then an ADME/Tox 
      analysis for the compound was carried out which showed that ellagic can be a 
      possible lead molecule.

TI  - Repeatability of monolithic HPLC columns while using a flow program.
PG  - 1745-9
LID - 10.1002/jssc.200700681 [doi]
AB  - Fast HPLC methods are becoming more and more important. Using monolithic HPLC 
      columns for fast separations, a flow program can be applied for further decrease 
      in the total run time. An interesting issue was whether the flow program affects 
      repeatability. The investigated method was a generic assay for the oral 
      antidiabetic drugs glibenclamide and glimepiride in the presence of two of their 
      degradation products. A flow program ranging from 5.0 to 9.9 mL/min had been set 
      up to decrease the run time to approximately 1.7 min. Within-day RSD% (n = 40) 
      for both retention times and peak areas were less than 1%. At flow rates higher 
      than 7 mL/min, repeatability was impaired to some extent. It became mainly 
      noticeable through the day-to-day precision (n = 60) which showed RSD% up to 2%. 
      However, further investigations indicated that this was rather related to pump 
      inefficiency at high flow rates than to the flow program as such. Presuming the 
      use of appropriate equipment, qualified for high flow rates, the application of a 
      flow program for shortening the run time is absolutely reasonable and does not 
      affect repeatability.

TI  - Evaluation of 170 xenobiotics as transactivators of human pregnane X receptor 
      (hPXR) and correlation to known CYP3A4 drug interactions.
PG  - 375-88
AB  - The human transcription factor pregnane X receptor (hPXR) is a key regulator of 
      enzyme expression, especially cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Due to the prominence 
      of CYP3A4 in the elimination of many drugs, the development of high throughput in 
      vitro models to predict the effect of drugs on CYP3A4 expression have increased. 
      To better interpret and predict potential drug-drug interactions due to CYP3A4 
      enzyme induction, we evaluated 170 xenobiotics in a hPXR transactivation assay 
      and compared these results to known clinical drug-drug interactions. Of the 170 
      xenobiotics tested, 54% of them demonstrated some level of hPXR transactivation. 
      By taking into consideration cell culture conditions (solubility, cytotoxicity, 
      appropriate drug concentration in media), as well as in vivo pharmacokinetics 
      (therapeutic plasma C(max), distribution, route of administration, dosing 
      regimen, liver exposure, potential to inhibit CYP3A4), the risk potential of 
      CYP3A4 enzyme induction for most compounds reduced dramatically. By employing 
      this overall interpretation strategy, the final percentage of compounds predicted 
      to significantly induce CYP3A4 reduced to 5%, all of which are known to cause 
      drug-drug interactions. Also, this is the first report that identifies several 
      potent compounds that have the ability to transactivate hPXR that previously have 
      not been identified, such as terbinafine, diclofenac, sildenafil, glimepiride, 
      montelukast, and ticlopidine.

TI  - ABCC8 polymorphism (Ser1369Ala): influence on severe hypoglycemia due to 
      sulfonylureas.
PG  - 1743-50
LID - 10.2217/pgs.10.135 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Sulfonylureas are categorized according to their binding sites of the 
      ATP-sensitive K+ channel (K(ATP) channel) complex in pancreatic β-cells. The 
      binding sites are classified as A, B and A + B site (both A and B sites), 
      respectively. The Ser1369Ala variant in the sulfonylurea receptor gene ABCC8 
      which encodes a subunit of the K(ATP) channel complex has been demonstrated to be 
      associated with the hypoglycemic effect of gliclazide, which binds to the A site. 
      However, the hypoglycemic effect of the Ser1369Ala variant on treatment with A + 
      B binding site sulfonylureas, such as glimepiride or glibenclamide, is still 
      uncertain. MATERIALS & METHODS: In a case-control study, 32 patients with Type 2 
      diabetes admitted to hospital with severe hypoglycemia and 125 consecutive Type 2 
      diabetic outpatients without severe hypoglycemia were enrolled. We determined the 
      genotypes of the ABCC8 polymorphism (Ser1369Ala) in the patients with or without 
      severe hypoglycemia. All of the patients were taking glimepiride or 
      glibenclamide. RESULTS: In the patients treated with glimepiride or 
      glibenclamide, we found no significant differences in the distribution of the 
      Ser1369Ala genotype between patients with or without severe hypoglycemia (p = 
      0.26). Moreover, the Ala1369 minor allele tended to be less frequent in the 
      hypoglycemic group (31 vs 43%; OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 0.92-2.96; p = 0.09). 
      CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the Ser1369Ala variant is not a major 
      predictive factor of severe hypoglycemia due to glimepiride or glibenclamide, 
      both of which bind to the A + B site. It is likely that severe hypoglycemia due 
      to A + B binding site sulfonylureas will be mediated by other factors, and not 
      the Ala1369 minor allele.

TI  - Are patients reliable when self-reporting medication use? Validation of 
      structured drug interviews and home visits by drug analysis and prescription data 
      in acutely hospitalized patients.
PG  - 1440-9
AB  - The medication history among hospitalized patients often relies on patients' 
      self-reports due to insufficient communication between health care professionals. 
      The aim of the present study was to estimate the reliability of patients' 
      self-reported medication use. Five hundred patients admitted to an acute medical 
      department at a Danish university hospital were interviewed on the day of 
      admission about their recent medication use. Blood samples drawn immediately 
      after admission were screened for contents of 5 drugs (digoxin, 
      bendroflumethiazide, amlodipine, simvastatin, glimepiride), and the results were 
      compared to the patients' self-reported medication history. Information on 
      prescribed drugs dispensed from any Danish pharmacy was collected from nationwide 
      real-time pharmacy records. The authors performed home visits in a subgroup of 
      115 patients 4 weeks after their discharge. Stored drugs were inspected, and 
      patients were interviewed about their drug use. Additional blood samples were 
      drawn for drug analysis. The median age of included patients was 72 years, and 
      298 patients (60%) were women. Patients reported use of 3 (median) 
      prescription-only medications (range, 0-14) during the structured interview. The 
      congruence between self-report and drug analysis was high for all 5 drugs 
      measured (all kappa >0.8). However, 9 patients (2%) reported use of drugs that 
      were not detected in their blood samples. In 29 patients (6%), the blood samples 
      contained drugs not reported during the structured interview, but 14 of these 
      drugs were registered in either hospital files or pharmacy records. Overall, the 
      sensitivity of information from hospital files, structured interviews, and 
      pharmacy records in identifying drug users was 87% to 93%, with no significant 
      differences between methods. In conclusion, patients' self-reports are reliable 
      when estimating recent use of cardiovascular and antidiabetic drugs.

TI  - Pancreatic beta-cell K(ATP) channel activity and membrane-binding studies with 
      nateglinide: A comparison with sulfonylureas and repaglinide.
PG  - 444-52
AB  - Nateglinide (A-4166) is an amino acid derivative with insulinotrophic action in 
      clinical development for treatment of type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was 
      to determine whether nateglinide's interaction at the K(ATP) channel/sulfonylurea 
      receptor underlies its more rapid onset and shorter duration of action in animal 
      models. Binding studies were carried out with membranes prepared from RIN-m5F 
      cells and HEK-293 cells expressing recombinant human sulfonylurea receptor 1 
      (SUR1). The relative order for displacement of [(3)H]glibenclamide in competitive 
      binding experiments with RIN-m5F cell membranes was glibenclamide > glimepiride > 
      repaglinide > glipizide > nateglinide > L-nateglinide > tolbutamide. The results 
      with HEK-293/recombinant human SUR1 cells were similar with the exception that 
      glipizide was more potent than repaglinide. Neither nateglinide nor repaglinide 
      had any effect on the dissociation kinetics for [(3)H]glibenclamide, consistent 
      with both compounds competitively binding to the glibenclamide-binding site on 
      SUR1. Finally, the inability to measure [(3)H]nateglinide binding suggests that 
      nateglinide dissociates rapidly from SUR1. Direct interaction of nateglinide with 
      K(ATP) channels in rat pancreatic beta-cells was investigated with the 
      patch-clamp method. The relative potency for inhibition of the K(ATP) channel was 
      repaglinide > glibenclamide > nateglinide. Kinetics of the inhibitory effect on 
      K(ATP) current showed that the onset of inhibition by nateglinide was comparable 
      to glibenclamide but more rapid than that of repaglinide. The time for reversal 
      of channel inhibition by nateglinide was also faster than with glibenclamide and 
      repaglinide. These results suggest that the unique characteristics of nateglinide 
      are largely the result of its interaction at the K(ATP) channel.

TI  - Effect of CYP2C9 polymorphisms on prescribed dose and time-to-stable dose of 
      sulfonylureas in primary care patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1517-23
LID - 10.2217/pgs.10.121 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Sulfonylureas are mainly metabolized by the enzyme CYP2C9. Two allelic 
      variants, CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, result in decreased metabolic capacity and have 
      been associated with elevated sulfonylurea serum levels. However, most of the 
      available data originates from pharmacokinetic analyses performed in healthy 
      individuals. In this study, the effect of CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles on 
      prescribed dose and time-to-stable dose of sulfonylureas was investigated. 
      MATERIALS & METHODS: A group of 207 incident sulfonylurea users treated in four 
      university affiliated primary care centers were identified. The effect of the 
      CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles on prescribed dose and time-to-stable dose was then 
      assessed. RESULTS: No significant effects of the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles 
      were found. However, a trend towards a lower stable glimepiride dose for carriers 
      of the CYP2C9*3 allele was observed. CONCLUSION: Genotyping for the CYP2C9*2 and 
      CYP2C9*3 alleles currently appears to have no clinical implications for dosing of 
      sulfonylureas in primary care patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

TI  - [Comparison study of two glimepiride formulations bioavailability in healthy 
      volunteers of both sexes after a single dose administration].
PG  - 950-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the bioavailability of two glimepiride 4-mg tablet 
      formulation in 26 healthy volunteers of both sexes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 
      study was conducted open with randomized two-period crossover design and a 14-day 
      washout period. Samples were obtained over a 48-hour interval. Glimepiride 
      concentrations were analyzed by LC-MS-MS. From the glimepiride plasma 
      concentration versus time curves the following pharmacokinetic parameters were 
      obtained: AUC(0-last), AUC(0-t), AUC(0-infinity), Ke, T1/2, Cmax, and Tmax. 
      RESULTS: Geometric mean of Glimepirida/Amaryl 4 mg was 102.35% for AUC(0-t), 
      102.35% for AUC(0-infinity) and 99.31% for Cmax. The 90% CI was 92.62-109.55%; 
      95.62-109.55% e 88.60-111.32%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Since the 90% CI for 
      both Cmax, AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-infinity) were within the interval of 80-125%, it 
      was concluded that both formulations were bioequivalent, according to both the 
      rate and extent of absorption.

TI  - Adenosine triphosphate-dependent K currents activated by metabolic inhibition in 
      rat ventricular myocytes differ from those elicited by the channel opener 
      rilmakalim.
PG  - 625-35
AB  - Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) dependent potassium channels (KATP channels) in 
      heart ventricular muscle cells can be activated by depletion of intracellular ATP 
      stores as well as by channel openers. In the present study we examined whether 
      properties of KATP channels are dependent on the mode of activation. Whole-cell 
      and single-channel currents were investigated by use of the patch-clamp technique 
      in isolated ventricular rat myocytes. The channel opener rilmakalim dose 
      dependently activated whole-cell currents [concentration for half-maximal 
      activation (EC50) = 1.1 microM, Hill coefficient = 3.1, saturation concentration 
      10 microM]. Metabolic inhibition with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (10 mmol/l) also 
      activated KATP currents after a time lag of several minutes. These currents were 
      about two-fold higher than the rilmakalim-activated currents 
      (rilmakalim-activated current 3.9 +/- 0.2 nA, 2-deoxy-D-glucose-activated current 
      8.1 +/- 0.9 nA; both recorded at 0 mV clamp potential). While the 
      rilmakalim-activated current could be blocked completely and with high affinity 
      by the sulphonylurea glibenclamide [concentration for half-maximal inhibition 
      (IC50) = 8 nM, Hill coefficient = 0.7] the 2-deoxy-D-glucose-activated current 
      could only be blocked partially (by maximally 46%) and higher glibenclamide 
      concentrations were needed (IC50 = 480 nM, Hill coefficient = 0.8). The partial 
      loss of blocking efficiency after metabolic inhibition was not restricted to 
      glibenclamide but was also observed with the sulfonylureas glimepiride and HB 
      985, as well as with the non-sulfonylureas HOE 511 and 5-hydroxy-decanoate. 
      Single-channel studies were in accordance with these whole-cell experiments. Both 
      rilmakalim and metabolic inhibition with the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 
      p-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP) activated single channels in the 
      attached mode, where the number of current levels was significantly higher in the 
      case of FCCP. Rilmakalim-activated channels were completely blocked by 10 microM 
      glibenclamide, whereas several single-channel levels appeared in the presence of 
      100 microM glibenclamide after metabolic inhibition. In conclusion, after 
      metabolic inhibition the amplitude of the activated KATP current is about twice 
      as high as under saturating concentrations of the opener rilmakalim. Moreover, 
      channels activated by metabolic inhibition lost part of their sensitivity to 
      known channel blockers.
