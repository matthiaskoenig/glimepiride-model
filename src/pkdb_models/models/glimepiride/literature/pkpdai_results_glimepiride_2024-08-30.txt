TI  - Dose Linearity of Glimepiride in Healthy Human Egyptian Volunteers.
PG  - 264-9
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.20 [doi]
AB  - The present study was adopted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and dose linearity 
      of glimepiride after administration of single oral doses of 1-6 mg glimepiride in 
      an open-label, five-way crossover study. Twenty-four healthy male Egyptian 
      volunteers were given 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 mg of glimepiride on five occasions, and 
      blood samples were collected over 24 hours. Plasma glimepiride concentrations 
      were assayed by a validated reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography 
      method with UV detection and the data were evaluated by non-compartmental methods 
      to determine pharmacokinetic parameters. The mean elimination half-lives (t1/2 ) 
      did not vary with the dose. The peak plasma levels (Cmax ) and area under the 
      plasma level versus time curve (AUC) data showed dose-proportional response. The 
      time to peak plasma concentration (tmax ), mean residence time, oral clearance 
      (Cl/F) and apparent volume of distribution (Vd /F) were all similar regardless of 
      the administered dose (P > .05). The 90% confidence intervals of the ratios of 
      dose-adjusted log transformed values of Cmax , AUC0-t , AUC0-∞ , t1/2 , and tmax 
      fell within the range of 80-125%. These findings suggest that glimepiride 
      disposition is linear over the dose range studied healthy human Egyptian 
      volunteers.

TI  - [Comparison study of two glimepiride formulations bioavailability in healthy 
      volunteers of both sexes after a single dose administration].
PG  - 950-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the bioavailability of two glimepiride 4-mg tablet 
      formulation in 26 healthy volunteers of both sexes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 
      study was conducted open with randomized two-period crossover design and a 14-day 
      washout period. Samples were obtained over a 48-hour interval. Glimepiride 
      concentrations were analyzed by LC-MS-MS. From the glimepiride plasma 
      concentration versus time curves the following pharmacokinetic parameters were 
      obtained: AUC(0-last), AUC(0-t), AUC(0-infinity), Ke, T1/2, Cmax, and Tmax. 
      RESULTS: Geometric mean of Glimepirida/Amaryl 4 mg was 102.35% for AUC(0-t), 
      102.35% for AUC(0-infinity) and 99.31% for Cmax. The 90% CI was 92.62-109.55%; 
      95.62-109.55% e 88.60-111.32%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Since the 90% CI for 
      both Cmax, AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-infinity) were within the interval of 80-125%, it 
      was concluded that both formulations were bioequivalent, according to both the 
      rate and extent of absorption.

TI  - Effects of fluconazole and fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of glimepiride.
PG  - 194-200
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to study the effects of fluconazole and fluvoxamine 
      on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glimepiride, a new sulfonylurea 
      antidiabetic drug. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, three-phase 
      crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers took 200 mg of fluconazole once daily (400 
      mg on day 1), 100 mg of fluvoxamine once daily, or placebo once daily for 4 days. 
      On day 4, a single oral dose of 0.5 mg of glimepiride was administered. Plasma 
      glimepiride and blood glucose concentrations were measured up to 12 hours. 
      RESULTS: In the fluconazole phase, the mean total area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve of glimepiride was 238% (P <.0001) and the peak plasma 
      concentration was 151% (P <.0001) of the respective control value. The mean 
      elimination half-life of glimepiride was prolonged from 2.0 to 3.3 hours (P 
      <.0001) by fluconazole. In the fluvoxamine phase, the mean area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve of glimepiride was not significantly different from that 
      in the placebo phase. However, the mean peak plasma concentration of glimepiride 
      was 143% (P <.05) of the control and the elimination half-life was prolonged from 
      2.0 to 2.3 hours (P <.01) by fluvoxamine. Fluconazole and fluvoxamine did not 
      cause statistically significant changes in the effects of glimepiride on blood 
      glucose concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Fluconazole considerably increased the area 
      under the plasma concentration-time curve of glimepiride and prolonged its 
      elimination half-life. This was probably caused by inhibition of the cytochrome 
      P-450 2C9-mediated biotransformation of glimepiride by fluconazole. Concomitant 
      use of fluconazole with glimepiride may increase the risk of hypoglycemia as much 
      as would a 2- to 3-fold increase in the dose of glimepiride. Fluvoxamine 
      moderately increased the plasma concentrations and slightly prolonged the 
      elimination half-life of glimepiride.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and safety of glimepiride at clinically effective doses in 
      diabetic patients with renal impairment.
PG  - 1617-24
AB  - The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of glimepiride were investigated in a 
      single- and a multiple-dose open study in patients with non-insulin-dependent 
      diabetes mellitus and renal impairment and an initial creatinine clearance above 
      10 ml/ min. Patients were divided into three groups with creatinine clearance 
      above 50 ml/min, 20-50 ml/min and under 20 ml/min. Fifteen fasting patients 
      received a single dose of 3 mg glimepiride and serial blood and urine samples 
      were taken over 24 h for pharmacokinetic and efficacy analyses. A further 16 
      patients received glimepiride over a 3-month period, an initial dose of 1 mg 
      glimepiride being adjusted within the range 1 to 8 mg to achieve good glucose 
      control. Pharmacokinetic evaluation was done on day 1 and after 3 months. Mean 
      relative total clearance and mean volume of distribution of both single (41.6 ml/ 
      min and 8.47 litres, respectively, when creatinine clearance was above 50 ml/min) 
      and multiple doses of glimepiride increased in proportion to the degree of renal 
      impairment (to 91.1 ml/min and 14.98 litres, respectively, when creatinine 
      clearance was below 20 ml/min, single dose), whereas the terminal halflife and 
      mean time remained unchanged. Lower relative total clearance and renal clearance 
      of both glimepiride metabolites correlated significantly with lower creatinine 
      clearance values. Of the 16 patients 12 required between 1 and 4 mg glimepiride 
      to stabilize their fasting blood glucose. Glimepiride was well-tolerated and 
      there were no drug-related adverse events. In conclusion glimepiride is safe, 
      effective and has clearly-definable pharmacokinetics in diabetic patients with 
      renal impairment. The increased plasma elimination of glimepiride with decreasing 
      kidney function is explainable on the basis of altered protein binding with an 
      increase in unbound drug.

TI  - Lack of pharmacokinetic interaction between dapagliflozin, a novel sodium-glucose 
      transporter 2 inhibitor, and metformin, pioglitazone, glimepiride or sitagliptin 
      in healthy subjects.
PG  - 47-54
LID - 10.1111/j.1463-1326.2010.01314.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Dapagliflozin increases urinary glucose excretion by selectively inhibiting 
      renal sodium-glucose transporter 2, an insulin-independent mechanism of action 
      that may be complementary to that of other oral antidiabetes drugs. The current 
      studies assessed the potential for pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between 
      dapagliflozin and pioglitazone, metformin, glimepiride or sitagliptin in healthy 
      subjects following single-dose administration. METHODS: In open-label, 
      randomized, three-period, three-treatment crossover studies, 24 subjects received 
      50 mg dapagliflozin, 45 mg pioglitazone or the combination, while 18 subjects 
      received 20 mg dapagliflozin, 1000 mg metformin or the combination. In an 
      open-label, randomized, five-period, five-treatment, unbalanced crossover study, 
      18 subjects first received 20 mg dapagliflozin, 4 mg glimepiride or the 
      combination, and afterward 100 mg sitagliptin or sitagliptin plus 20 mg 
      dapagliflozin. Blood samples were taken over 72 h of each treatment period. Lack 
      of PK interaction was defined as the ratio of geometric means and 90% confidence 
      interval (CI) for combination:monotherapy being within the range of 0.80-1.25. 
      RESULTS: Co-administration of dapagliflozin with pioglitazone, metformin, 
      glimepiride or sitagliptin had no effect on dapagliflozin maximum plasma 
      concentration (C(max) ) or area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). 
      Similarly, dapagliflozin did not affect the C(max) or AUC for the co-administered 
      drug, except for slight extensions of the 90% CI for the ratio of geometric means 
      for glimepiride AUC (upper limit 1.29) and pioglitazone C(max) (lower limit 
      0.75). All monotherapies and combination therapies were well tolerated. 
      CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin can be co-administered with pioglitazone, metformin, 
      glimepiride or sitagliptin without dose adjustment of either drug.

TI  - Absolute bioavailability of glimepiride (Amaryl) after oral administration.
PG  - 331-9
AB  - Twelve healthy fasting male volunteers received a single 1.0 mg dose of 
      glimepiride either as an intravenous injection over one minute or as a tablet. 
      Blood and urine samples were taken before drug administration and afterwards for 
      up to 24 hours (blood) and 48 hours (urine) to determine serum and urinary 
      concentrations of glimepiride and its hydroxy- and carboxy-metabolites (M1 and 
      M2). There were no statistically significant differences between mean serum 
      pharmacokinetic parameters for the oral and intravenous formulations either with 
      glimepiride or M1. Mean urinary recovery of M1 plus M2 was 50% of the dose for 
      the glimepiride tablet and 51% for the intravenous injection. The absolute 
      bioavailability of the tablet formulation was 107% (AUDC(glimepiride)), 109% 
      (AUDC(M1)) and 97% (urinary recovery). The tablet formulation of glimepiride is 
      completely bioavailable and was safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers.

TI  - Effect of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glimepiride.
PG  - 591-5
AB  - AIMS: To study the effects of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmaco-dynamics of glimepiride, a new sulphonylurea antidiabetic drug. METHODS: 
      In this randomised, two-phase cross-over study, 10 healthy volunteers were 
      treated for 5 days with 600 mg rifampicin or placebo once daily. On day 6, a 
      single oral dose of 1 mg glimepiride was administered. Plasma glimepiride and 
      blood glucose concentrations were measured up to 12 h. RESULTS: Rifampicin 
      decreased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve of glimepiride 
      by 34% (P < 0.001) and the mean elimination half-life by 25% (P < 0.05). No 
      significant differences in the blood glucose response to glimepiride were 
      observed between the placebo and rifampicin phases. However, symptomatic 
      hypoglycaemia occurred only during the placebo phase. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of 
      rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride suggest that rifampicin induced 
      the CYP2C9-mediated metabolism of glimepiride and thereby slightly increased its 
      systemic clearance. Because the interaction was modest and did not significantly 
      alter the glucose-lowering effect of glimepiride in healthy volunteers, it is 
      probably of limited clinical significance. However, in some patients the 
      hypoglycaemic effect of glimepiride may be reduced during concomitant treatment 
      with rifampicin.

TI  - Effect of gemfibrozil on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
      glimepiride.
PG  - 439-45
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to study the effects of gemfibrozil on the 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glimepiride, a new sulfonylurea 
      antidiabetic drug and a substrate of cytochrome P4502C9 (CYP2C9). METHODS: In a 
      randomized, 2-phase crossover study, 10 healthy volunteers were treated for 2 
      days with 600 mg oral gemfibrozil or placebo twice daily. On day 3, they received 
      a single dose of 600 mg gemfibrozil or placebo and 1 hour later a single dose of 
      0.5 mg glimepiride orally. Plasma glimepiride, serum insulin, and blood glucose 
      concentrations were measured up to 12 hours. RESULTS: Gemfibrozil increased the 
      mean total area under the plasma concentration-time curve of glimepiride by 23% 
      (range, 6%-56%; P <.005). The mean elimination half-life of glimepiride was 
      prolonged from 2.1 to 2.3 hours (P <.05) by gemfibrozil. No statistically 
      significant differences were found in the serum insulin or blood glucose 
      variables between the two phases. CONCLUSIONS: Gemfibrozil modestly increases the 
      plasma concentrations of glimepiride. This may be caused by inhibition of CYP2C9.

TI  - Development of Solid-Phase Extraction and HPLC Method for Simultaneous Estimation 
      of Ilaprazole and Glimepiride in Rat Plasma: Application to Pharmacokinetic 
      Studies.
PG  - 327-333
LID - 10.1093/chromsci/bmw189 [doi]
AB  - A novel, simple and mass spectrometry (MS) compatible high-performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC) method is reported for the simultaneous estimation of 
      ilaprazole (ILA) and glimepiride (GLM) in rat plasma. The bio-analytical 
      procedure involves extraction of ILA, GLM and internal standard (IS) from rat 
      plasma with a solid-phase extraction (SPE) process. The chromatographic analysis 
      was performed on Waters-600 system using an isocratic mobile phase comprising 
      methanol:water (80:20 % v/v) with pH of water modified to three using formic acid 
      at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and Kinetex C18 column maintained at 30 ± 1°C. The 
      signals were monitored using a PDA detector set at 225 nm. IS, ILA and GLM eluted 
      at 2.04, 4.7 and 7.4 min, respectively, and the total run time was 10 min. Method 
      validation was performed as per US Food and Drug Administration guidelines and 
      the results met the acceptance criteria. The calibration curve was linear over a 
      concentration range of 10-600 ng/mL (r2 = 0.999). The intra- and inter-day 
      precisions for ILA and GLM were (%RSD values) in the range of 1.52-9.74 and 
      1.52-11.76%, respectively, in rat plasma. The method was successfully applied in 
      pharmacokinetic studies followed by oral administration of GLM and ILA in rats.

LID - 10.1080/03639045.2017.1310224 [doi]
AB  - This study was designed to investigate the potency of niosomes, for glimepiride 
      (GLM) encapsulation, aiming at enhancing its oral bioavailability and 
      hypoglycemic efficacy. Niosomes containing nonionic surfactants (NIS) were 
      prepared by thin film hydration technique and characterized. In-vitro release 
      study was performed using a dialysis technique. In-vivo pharmacodynamic studies, 
      as well as pharmacokinetic evaluation were performed on alloxan-induced diabetic 
      rats. GLM niosomes exhibited high-entrapment efficiency percentages (E.E. %) up 
      to 98.70% and a particle size diameter ranging from 186.8 ± 18.69 to 
      797.7 ± 12.45 nm, with negatively charged zeta potential (ZP). Different GLM 
      niosomal formulation showed retarded in vitro release, compared to free drug. 
      In-vivo studies revealed the superiority of GLM niosomes in lowering blood 
      glucose level (BGL) and in maintaining a therapeutic level of GLM for a longer 
      period of time, as compared to free drug and market product. There was no 
      significant difference between mean plasma AUC(0-48 hr) of GLM-loaded niosomes 
      and that of market product. GLM-loaded niosomes exhibited seven-fold enhancement 
      in relative bioavailability in comparison with free drug. These findings 
      reinforce the potential use of niosomes for enhancing the oral bioavailability 
      and prolonged delivery of GLM via oral administration.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetic analysis of glimepiride with CYP2C9 genetic 
      polymorphism in healthy Korean subjects.
PG  - 889-98
LID - 10.1007/s00228-011-1035-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to develop a population pharmacokinetic 
      (PPK) model of glimepiride and to investigate the influence of genetic 
      polymorphisms in CYP2C9 on the PPK of glimepiride in healthy Korean subjects. 
      METHODS: Serum data after a single oral dose of 2 mg of glimepiride in 177 
      healthy male Korean subjects (CYP2C9*1*1: 163 subjects, *1/*3: 14 subjects) were 
      used. We estimated the PPK of glimepiride using a nonlinear mixed effects 
      modeling (NONMEM) method and explored the possible influence of genetic 
      polymorphisms in CYP2C9 on the PPK of glimepiride. RESULTS: The disposition of 
      glimepiride was best described with a two-compartment model with a Weibull-type 
      absorption and first-order elimination. The visual predictive check indicated 
      that the pharmacokinetic profile of glimepiride was adequately described by the 
      proposed PPK model. The CYP2C9 genotypes as covariate significantly (P < 0.001) 
      influenced the apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of glimepiride. The estimated CL/F 
      of glimepiride was higher (1.60-fold) in CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects than in CYP2C9*1/*3 
      subjects. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C9 
      influence the substantial interindividual variability in the disposition of 
      glimepiride, and these polymorphisms may affect the clinical response to 
      glimepiride therapy.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of a fixed-dose glimepiride/sustained-release metformin 
      combination.
PG  - 142-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of glimepiride and metformin have been 
      established for the combination drug as well as each agent individually. However, 
      the PK profiles of a combination drug containing glimepiride and 
      sustained-release (SR) metformin have not been reported. To compare the 
      pharmacokinetic profiles of glimepiride/SR metformin (2 mg/500 mg) with the PK of 
      immediate-release (IR) formulations, an open-label, randomized, 3-period, 
      3-sequence, 3-treatment, crossover study was conducted in 12 healthy subjects. 
      METHODS: After a single administration of glimepiride/SR metformin 2 mg/500 mg 
      (Treatment) or glimepiride/metformin IR 2 mg/500 mg (Reference 1), or 
      administration of 2 doses of glimepiride/metformin IR 1 mg/250 mg 12 h apart 
      (Reference 2), serial blood samples were collected and drug concentrations 
      determined by liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry. PK parameters 
      (Cmax and AUC24) for glimepiride and metformin were log-transformed and compared 
      using a mixed-effects model analysis of variance (ANOVA). The mean differences 
      and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were back-transformed to obtain geometric mean 
      ratios along with the CIs for the ratios. RESULTS: Treatment demonstrated similar 
      systemic exposures for glimepiride; the geometric mean ratio (95% CIs) for 
      glimepiride AUC24 was 1.05 (0.97 - 1.13) for Treatment relative to Reference 1 
      and 1.08 (1.00 - 1.17) for Treatment relative to Reference 2. The SR formulation 
      showed a delay in the time to reach maximum concentration for metformin from 1.0 
      - 4.0 h to 4.0 - 8.0 h and a decreased AUC24 value; the geometric mean ratio for 
      metformin AUC24 was 0.87 (0.74 - 1.03) for Treatment relative to Reference 1 and 
      0.75 (0.63 - 0.88) for Treatment relative to Reference 2. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      demonstrates for the first time that fixed-dose glimepiride and SR metformin 2 
      mg/500 mg shows a PK profile similar to that of glimepiride, but with a delayed 
      time to maximum concentration and slightly decreased bioavailability for 
      metformin compared with the IR fixed-dose combination, in healthy volunteers. PK 
      profiles from this exploratory study will be helpful in designing and conducting 
      further studies in diabetic patients.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glimepiride in type 2 diabetic patients: 
      compared effects of once- versus twice-daily dosing.
PG  - 571-6
AB  - To compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of glimepiride between 
      once- and twice-daily dosing in type 2 diabetic patients. Eight Japanese type 2 
      diabetic patients, who had been treated with 2 mg glimepiride alone over 4 weeks 
      (age 40-70, body mass index <or=25 kg/m2, hemoglobin A 1C<8.0%), were randomly 
      assigned to the crossover study with glimepiride 2 mg once-daily and 1 mg 
      twice-daily for 4 weeks for each regime. Serum concentrations of glimepiride, 
      plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptide were measured over 24 h at the fixed time 
      intervals on the last day of each crossover period, and HbA 1C was measured at 
      the same day. Pharmacokinetic profiles in two regimens were different to each 
      others; a single peak of serum glimepiride concentration was observed in 
      once-daily, and double peaks in twice-daily dosing. Drug concentration increased 
      immediately, and peaked at 2 h after administration irrespective of dosage. Cmax 
      value in once-daily dose was higher than those in twice-daily doses. AUC values 
      were not different between two regimens. Pharmacodynamic profiles for plasma 
      glucoses, serum insulin and C-peptide showed no statistically significant 
      differences between two regimens, and parameters were not different each other. 
      Analyses of adverse events and laboratory data demonstrated a favorable safety 
      profile of glimepiride. The present results suggest that glimepiride may be 
      suitable for once-daily dosing with respect to clinical usefulness.

      microemulsion technique.
PG  - 3777-88
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S105419 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this work was to prepare an oil/water glimepiride (GM) 
      microemulsion (ME) for oral administration to improve its solubility and enhance 
      its bioavailability. Based on a solubility study, pseudoternary phase diagrams, 
      and Box-Behnken design, the oil/water GMME formulation was optimized and 
      prepared. GMME was characterized by dynamic laser light scattering, zeta 
      potential, transmission electron microscopy, and viscosity. The in vitro drug 
      release, storage stability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of GMME were 
      investigated. The optimized GMME was composed of Capryol 90 (oil), Cremophor RH40 
      (surfactant), and Transcutol (cosurfactant), and increased GM solubility up to 
      544.6±4.91 µg/mL. The GMME was spherical in shape. The particle size and its 
      polydispersity index were 38.9±17.46 nm and 0.266±0.057, respectively. Meanwhile, 
      the GMME was physicochemically stable at 4°C for at least 3 months. The 
      short-term efficacy in diabetic mice provided the proof that blood glucose had a 
      consistent and significant reduction at a dose of 375 µg/kg whether via IP 
      injection or IG administration of GMME. Compared with the glimepiride suspensions 
      or glimepiride-meglumine complex solution, the pharmacokinetics of GMME in Wistar 
      rats via IG administration exhibited higher plasma drug concentration, larger 
      area under the curve, and more enhanced oral bioavailability. There was a good 
      correlation of GMME between the in vitro release values and the in vivo oral 
      absorption. ME could be an effective oral drug delivery system to improve 
      bioavailability of GM.

      of Glimepiride 1-mg in Chinese Subjects.
PG  - 2637-2644
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S249355 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Glimepiride, an FDA-approved oral hypoglycemic drug, is a long-acting 
      sulfonylurea (SU), used for treating type 2 diabetes. The study aimed to evaluate 
      the bioequivalence and safety profiles of two different formulations of 
      glimepiride 1 mg from two different manufactures in healthy Chinese subjects in 
      the fasting and fed state in order to acquire adequate pharmacokinetic evidence 
      for registration approval of the test formulation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This 
      study is an open-label, two-period, two-sequence, randomized, two-way crossover 
      pharmacokinetic study in healthy Chinese subjects in the fasting and fed state. 
      Seventy-two subjects were randomly assigned to the fasting group and the fed 
      group (n=36 each). We collected blood samples, 24-h post drug administration. The 
      plasma concentration of glimepiride was assessed using HPLC coupled with mass 
      spectrometry. The following parameters were evaluated: AUC(0-inf), AUC(0-last), 
      C(max), t(1⁄2), T(max), and λ(z). Safety was determined based on the occurrence 
      of adverse events (AEs) and laboratory examinations (biochemistry, hematology, 
      and urinalysis) throughout the entire study period. RESULTS: The geometric mean 
      ratios (GMR) amongst the two glimepiride formulations for the primary 
      pharmacokinetic parameters, ie, AUC(0-inf), AUC(0-last), and C(max) as well as 
      the corresponding 90% CIs, were all within the range of 80.00-125.00% in the 
      fasting and fed state. The safety profile for both treatments was comparable. 
      CONCLUSION: PK analysis revealed that the test and reference formulations of 
      glimepiride were bioequivalent and well tolerated in healthy Chinese subjects.

      Pharmacokinetics Studies.
PG  - 49-59
LID - 10.4103/jpbs.JPBS_200_18 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Diet and beverages are thought to have notable effects on drugs. 
      Recently, this relationship has received significant consideration. AIMS: To 
      develop and validate a simple, rapid, and sensitive method for the determination 
      of glimepiride in rat serum. This will be performed using high-performance liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Potential pharmacokinetic 
      interactions between glimepiride and the soft drink, Vimto, will also be 
      investigated in the serum of experimental rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HPLC-MS/MS 
      was constructed and clarithromycin was used as an internal standard. RESULTS: The 
      method was validated in terms of linearity, precision, accuracy, stability, and 
      system suitability parameters. The method was found to be satisfactory and 
      suitable for the determination of glimepiride. The precision of glimepiride was 
      high (coefficient of variation, CV% <15%), the accuracy over all 3 days of 
      validation was within the accepted criteria. Glimepiride peak serum concentration 
      (C (max)) was 126.01 ng/mL and was reached within 1 h (T (max)) of 
      administration. Mean area under curve (AUC) was 964.70 ng/mL and was reached 
      within 24 h of administration. The Vimto soft drink significantly (P < 0.050) 
      reduced glimepiride peak serum concentration to 57.87 ng/mL and was reached 
      within 2 h of administration. AUC was significantly reduced to 335.04 ng(*)h/mL 
      (P < 0.050). CONCLUSION: Glimepiride pharmacokinetic parameters such as C (max) 
      and AUC were significantly affected by the Vimto soft drink. Therefore, this 
      study developed a simple, rapid, and sensitive method for validation and 
      determination of the effects of soft drinks on drugs using the LC-MS/MS method.

TI  - Evaluation of pharmacokinetic drug interactions between gemigliptin 
      (dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitor) and glimepiride (sulfonylurea) in healthy 
      volunteers.
PG  - 165-76
LID - 10.1007/s40268-014-0054-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Gemigliptin is approved for the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus. 
      Sulfonylureas are commonly used in combination with other antidiabetic drugs to 
      improve glycemic control. The objective of this study was to evaluate the 
      pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of gemigliptin and glimepiride 
      combination therapy compared with those of monotherapies. METHODS: A randomized, 
      open-label, crossover study was performed on healthy Korean male volunteers. Each 
      subject received the following treatments (A and B) with a 7-day washout period: 
      treatment A consisted of gemigliptin 50 mg once daily administered orally for 6 
      days, followed by concomitant oral dosing of glimepiride 4 mg and gemigliptin 50 
      mg on day 7; treatment B consisted of a single dose of glimepiride 4 mg. Blood 
      samples were collected up to 24-h postdose on day 6 (gemigliptin) and day 7 
      (gemigliptin and glimepiride) following treatment A, and on day 1 (glimepiride) 
      following treatment B. Concentrations of gemigliptin, glimepiride, and 
      metabolites were determined using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Safety assessments were performed throughout the study. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-three subjects completed the study. The geometric mean ratios 
      (GMRs) of C max,ss and AUC τ,ss for gemigliptin were 1.0097 [90 % confidence 
      interval (CI) 0.924-1.103] and 0.9997 (90 % CI 0.976-1.024), respectively. For 
      glimepiride, the GMRs of C max and AUClast were 1.031 (90 % CI 0.908-1.172) and 
      0.995 (90 % CI 0.902-1.097), respectively. Both combination and monotherapy were 
      well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: 
      Gemigliptin and glimepiride did not alter the pharmacokinetic properties of each 
      other when they were co-administered in healthy volunteers, and were generally 
      tolerated.

TI  - Replicate study design in bioequivalency assessment, pros and cons: 
      bioavailabilities of the antidiabetic drugs pioglitazone and glimepiride present 
      in a fixed-dose combination formulation.
PG  - 806-16
AB  - An open-label, randomized, 2-sequence, 4-period crossover (7-day washout period 
      between treatment), replicate design study was conducted in 37 healthy subjects 
      to assess intersubject and intrasubject variabilities in the peak (Cmax) and 
      total (AUC) exposures to 2 oral antidiabetic drugs, pioglitazone and glimepiride, 
      after single doses of 30 mg pioglitazone and 4 mg glimepiride, given under fasted 
      state, as commercial tablets coadministered or as a single fixed-dose combination 
      tablet. Variabilities for AUC(infinity) for coadministered and fixed-dose 
      combination treatments were similar: 16% to 19% (intra) and 23% to 25% (inter) 
      for pioglitazone and 18% to 19% (intra) and 29% to 30% for glimepiride (inter, 
      excluding 1 poor metabolizer). Fixed-dose combination/coadministered least 
      squares mean ratios of >or=0.86 and the 90% confidence intervals of these ratios 
      for pioglitazone and glimepiride of between 0.80 and 1.25 for Cmax, AUC(lqc), and 
      AUC(infinity) met the bioequivalency standards. Gender analysis showed that women 
      showed mean of 16% and 30% higher exposure than men for glimepiride (excluding 1 
      poor metabolizer) and pioglitazone, respectively. There was considerable 
      overlapping in the AUC(infinity) values, making gender-dependent dosing 
      unnecessary. Patients taking pioglitazone and glimepiride as cotherapy may 
      replace their medication with a single fixed-dose combination tablet containing 
      these 2 oral antidiabetic drugs.

TI  - Glimepiride pharmacokinetics in obese versus non-obese diabetic patients.
PG  - 30-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is a global concern, accounting for the vast majority 
      of cases of diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is associated with insulin deficiency and 
      insulin resistance and, increasingly, with patients who are overweight or obese. 
      Glimepiride is a popular choice of oral antidiabetic agent for patients with Type 
      2 diabetes since it increases both insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity and, 
      unlike some other oral agents, is associated with weight neutrality or even 
      weight loss. OBJECTIVE: To assess the pharmacokinetic characteristics of 
      glimepiride and its metabolites in normal-weight and morbidly obese patients with 
      type 2 diabetes to determine whether the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride are 
      altered by obesity. METHODS: Normal-weight (n = 14) and morbidly obese (n = 14) 
      men and women (in a 1:1 ratio) with type 2 diabetes received a single oral dose 
      of glimepiride 8 mg following an overnight fast. Serum concentrations of 
      glimepiride and its metabolites, cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl derivative (MI) and 
      carboxyl derivative (MII), and urinary concentrations of these metabolites were 
      measured. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the 2 patient 
      groups for glimepiride in terms of mean peak concentration (C(max)) (p = 0.0807), 
      time to reach C(max) (t(max)) (p = 0.9916), AUC(0-24) (p = 0.2609), AUC(0- 
      infinity ) (p = 0.1275), or terminal half-life (p = 0.3076). Mean t(max) values 
      and relative total clearances for the 2 groups were also equivalent. Some 
      differences were noted with respect to the pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
      between the groups. In particular, over a 24-hour period, the morbidly obese 
      group excreted statistically significantly greater amounts of MI (p = 0.0430) and 
      MII (p = 0.0051) compared with the normal-weight group. However, none of the 
      differences was considered clinically significant since these metabolites do not 
      have meaningful pharmacologic activity. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results 
      presented here indicate that no intrinsic difference is observed in the oral 
      clearance of glimepiride in obese patients compared with non-obese patients. 
      Given that the dosage is titrated to achieve optimal fasting glucose levels, no 
      special dose consideration is required for the use of glimepiride in the 
      treatment of obese patients with type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Glyburide and glimepiride pharmacokinetics in subjects with different CYP2C9 
      genotypes.
PG  - 326-32
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to investigate the effects of genetic polymorphisms 
      of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 on the pharmacokinetics of glyburide (INN, 
      glibenclamide) and glimepiride, two widely used sulfonylurea antidiabetic drugs. 
      METHODS: We conducted CYP2C9 genotyping for 29 healthy volunteers who had 
      participated in our previous pharmacokinetic studies on glyburide or glimepiride. 
      RESULTS: There were 17 subjects (59%) with the CYP2C9*1/*1 (wild-type) genotype, 
      8 (28%) with the CYP2C9*1/*2 genotype, 3 (10%) with the CYP2C9*1/*3 genotype, and 
      1 (3%) with the CYP2C9*2/*3 genotype. The pharmacokinetics of glyburide or 
      glimepiride were not significantly changed among subjects with the CYP2C9*1/*2 
      genotype. However, in individuals heterozygous for the CYP2C9*3 allele, the 
      median total area under the plasma concentration-time curve of glyburide (n = 2) 
      was 280% (P < or = .05) and that of glimepiride (n = 3) was 267% (P < or = .01) 
      of the respective values in subjects with the CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype (n = 5 and n = 
      12, respectively). Blood glucose responses to glyburide and glimepiride were not 
      significantly affected by the CYP2C9 genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic polymorphisms 
      of CYP2C9 markedly affect the pharmacokinetics of both glyburide and glimepiride. 
      The influence of the CYP2C9*3 variant allele on glyburide and glimepiride 
      pharmacokinetics may be clinically significant.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Interactions Between Evogliptin and Glimepiride 
      in Healthy Male Subjects.
PG  - 5179-5187
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S275343 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Evogliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, and glimepiride, a 
      sulfonylurea, are used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, we aimed 
      to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) interactions 
      between evogliptin and glimepiride. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized, 
      open-label, 3-period, 3-treatment, 2-sequence crossover study was conducted in 
      healthy male subjects. During each period, subjects received multiple doses of 
      evogliptin 5 mg alone (EVO), glimepiride 4 mg alone (GLI), or a combination of 
      the two (EVO+GLI). Serial blood and urine samples were collected 168 and 24 h 
      post dosing, respectively, for PK and PD analyses. RESULTS: Thirty-four subjects 
      completed the study. The co-administration of evogliptin and glimepiride did not 
      alter their plasma and urine PK profiles. For evogliptin, the geometric mean 
      ratio (GMR) (90% confidence intervals) for the maximum plasma concentrations at 
      steady-state (C(max,ss)) and the area under the curve during dosing interval at 
      steady-state (AUC(τ,ss)) of EVO+GLI to E were 1.02 (0.98-1.06) and 0.97 
      (0.95-1.00), respectively. For glimepiride, the corresponding values of EVO+GLI 
      to GLI were 1.08 (1.01-1.17) and 1.08 (1.02-1.14), respectively. All values were 
      within the regulatory bioequivalence criteria of 0.8-1.25. Glucose excursion 
      decreased with the co-administration of evogliptin and glimepiride compared with 
      that observed with the evogliptin or glimepiride monotherapy. CONCLUSION: 
      Evogliptin and glimepiride had no PK interactions when co-administered, while the 
      combination therapy showed an additive glucose-lowering effect compared to those 
      of evogliptin or glimepiride monotherapy.

TI  - Sex difference in pharmacokinetics of the novel sulfonylurea antidiabetic 
      glimepiride in rats.
PG  - 1317-21
AB  - Glimepiride (Hoe 490, CAS 93479-97-1), a novel sulfonylurea antidiabetic agent, 
      was studied for the cause of sex-related difference in the elimination clearance 
      of the unchanged drug in rats. After intravenous and oral administration, the 
      serum level of the unchanged drug was higher in female rats and AUC and t1/2 
      (beta) values were about 1.7- and 1.4-fold those for males, while Vss and oral 
      bioavailability were nearly equal. The excretion clearance of the unchanged drug 
      was quite small in both male and female animals, and most of the administered 
      drug was excreted into the bile as a hydroxymethyl derivative, M1. In the in 
      vitro metabolism study, M1 was found to be formed mainly in the liver microsomal 
      fraction, and its hydroxylation activity was significantly higher in males. This 
      metabolic activity was dependent on NADPH and was inhibited by proadifen. On the 
      other hand, formation of M2, a carboxyl derivative, from M1 was observed in the 
      cytosol fraction and showed no sex difference. Its metabolic activity depended on 
      NAD and was inhibited by pyrazole. These results suggest that the sex difference 
      observed in rat pharmacokinetics is mainly due to different hydroxylation 
      activities of the side chain methyl group based on the participation of sex 
      dependent cytochrome P-450 in liver microsomes.

TI  - Bioequivalence assessment of the two brands of glimepiride tablets.
PG  - 1015-20
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Glimepiride, as an antidiabetic from the group of sulfonylurea, 
      is administered perorally in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The aim of this 
      study was to compare pharmacokinetic profiles and relative bioavailabilities of 
      the two oral formulations of glimepiride, generic and innovator tablets, after a 
      single dose of the active drug. METHODS: An oral dose of 6 mg glimepiride was 
      given under fasting conditions to 24 healthy volunteers. A one-week washout 
      period was applied between the two consecutive periods. The serum samples 
      obtained before dosing, and at various time points up to 48 hours, were analyzed 
      for glimepiride concentration using the validated high-performance liquid 
      chromatographic method with ultraviolet detection. Pharmacokinetic parameters 
      representing early (maximal concentration, time to reach maximal concentration) 
      and total exposure (area under the curve from the time 0 to the infinite time) to 
      glimepiride were obtained and further analyzed using the multifactorial analysis 
      of variance and the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Comparison of the 
      secondary kinetic variables was only descriptive. RESULTS: The point estimates of 
      the ratios of geometric means (test/reference) of maximal concentrations and 
      areas under the curve were 1.046 (90% confidence interval: 0.906-1.208) and 1.022 
      (90% confidence interval: 0.856-1.220), respectively, while the median values of 
      times to reach maximal concentration, at 5% level of significance, did not differ 
      significantly. Both formulations were well tolerated. Transient mild 
      hypoglycaemia, which had been noted in 6 participants, resolved spontaneously 
      within 30-60 minutes. CONCLUSION: Since all the parametric 90% confidence 
      intervals for the log-transformed main variables of glimepiride were within the 
      0.80 and 1.25 interval, accepted as the definition of bioequivalence, and the 
      differences in times to reach maximal concentration also did not reach 
      statistical significance, studied tablets were considered bioequivalent.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic modeling of glimepiride plasma concentration in healthy subjects.
PG  - 949-53
AB  - AIM: To determine the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride, a sulfonylurea 
      antidiabetic agent, after single dose administration in healthy subjects. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pharmacokinetic data for modeling were extracted from a 
      single-center, randomized, single-dose, fasting state, two-way crossover 
      bioequivalence study on 4 mg glimepiride in 24 healthy subjects. RESULTS: Plasma 
      concentrations of glimepiride were measured using a validated LC/MS/MS method. 
      The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using non-compartmental analysis. 
      Different pharmacokinetic models were tested to evaluate pharmacokinetics of 
      glimepiride. The optimal model was chosen based on Akaike's Information Criteria. 
      CONCLUSION: Compartmental analysis demonstrated that oral glimepiride tablets 
      obey one compartment open model with rapid absorption following a first order 
      kinetics and a short half-life.

TI  - Effect of glimepiride on the pharmacokinetics of teneligliptin in healthy Korean 
      subjects.
PG  - 720-725
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.12848 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Teneligliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor used for the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, commonly prescribed in combination with 
      glimepiride. Teneligliptin is metabolized by CYP3A4, and glimepiride might be 
      partly metabolized by CYP3A4. The aim of the study was to investigate the 
      possible effect of glimepiride on the pharmacokinetics of teneligliptin in 
      healthy subjects. METHODS: A repeated dose, open-label, fixed-sequence study was 
      conducted in 26 healthy subjects. All participants were administered 20 mg 
      teneligliptin daily for 6 days. On day 7, 4 mg glimepiride was administered 
      together with 20 mg teneligliptin. Plasma teneligliptin concentrations were 
      measured at a steady state, and its pharmacokinetic characteristics were compared 
      without and with glimepiride. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: No statistically 
      significant difference was found in the effect of glimepiride on teneligliptin 
      pharmacokinetics. The steady-state C(max,ss) values of teneligliptin without and 
      with glimepiride were 207.01 ng/mL and 202.15 ng/mL, respectively. Its AUC(τ) 
      values at steady-state without and with glimepiride were 1527.8 ng · h/mL and 
      1578.6 ng · h/mL, respectively. The point estimation of geometric mean ratios 
      (GMR) and the 90% confidence interval for both C(max,ss) and AUC(τ) were within 
      the equivalence range of 0.8-1.25. The results of the present study revealed that 
      glimepiride did not cause pharmacokinetic interaction with teneligliptin in 
      humans. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Glimepiride did not affect the 
      pharmacokinetic characteristics of teneligliptin in healthy subjects.

TI  - The effects of colesevelam HCl on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of 
      glimepiride, extended-release glipizide, and olmesartan medoxomil.
PG  - 61-9
LID - 10.1002/jcph.180 [doi]
AB  - Bile acid sequestrants can potentially bind to concomitant drugs. Single-dose 
      studies evaluated the effects of colesevelam on the pharmacokinetics of 
      glimepiride, glipizide extended-release (ER), and olmesartan medoxomil. Each 
      study enrolled healthy subjects aged 18-45 years. The olmesartan medoxomil study 
      used a randomized adaptive crossover design that initially compared olmesartan 
      medoxomil alone versus simultaneously with colesevelam, then olmesartan medoxomil 
      alone versus 4 hours before colesevelam. The other studies used a three-period 
      crossover design (test drug alone, test drug simultaneously with colesevelam, and 
      test drug 4 hours before colesevelam). For the colesevelam coadministration 
      periods, 3,750 mg once daily was dosed throughout the pharmacokinetic sampling 
      period. After each single dose of test drug, serial blood samples were collected 
      for determination of plasma drug concentrations and calculation of 
      pharmacokinetic parameters. Administering colesevelam simultaneously with 
      glimepiride or glipizide ER resulted in minor reductions (18% and 13%, 
      respectively) in total exposure that were negated by staggering colesevelam 
      dosing by 4 hours. Administering colesevelam simultaneously with olmesartan 
      medoxomil resulted in a major reduction (39%) in olmesartan exposure that was 
      reduced by staggering colesevelam dosing by 4 hours. This reduction in olmesartan 
      exposure is not predicted to have a clinically significant impact on blood 
      pressure control.

AB  - The rapid, sensitive, and selective liquid chromatography-electrospray 
      ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-ESI-MS/MS) for the simultaneous 
      estimation and pharmacokinetic investigation of glimepiride and pioglitazone in 
      human plasma has been developed and fully validated. Glimepiride and 
      pioglitazone, compounds which exert synergistic effects on blood glucose control, 
      were investigated in human plasma using deuterium-labeled analogs as internal 
      standards (IS). Liquid-liquid extraction was carried out on 0.2 mL of human 
      plasma using ethyl acetate, and chromatographic separation was performed on an 
      Agilent Eclipse plus C18 column (4.6 mm × 100 mm, 3.5 μm) using a mobile phase 
      consisting of methanol-water-formic acid (95:5:0.1, v/v/v, plus 5mM ammonium 
      acetate) at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. To quantify glimepiride, pioglitazone and 
      their IS, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions of m/z 491.2→352.2, m/z 
      496.2→357.2, m/z 357.2→134.2 and m/z 361.2→138.2 were performed in positive mode. 
      The total run time was 3.0 min and the elution time was about 2.4 min. The method 
      exhibited good separation of analytes, without interference from endogenous 
      substances. The linear calibration curves were 0.2-250 ng/mL for glimepiride and 
      0.2-1,250 ng/mL for pioglitazone; the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 
      0.2 ng/mL for both analytes. Intra- and inter-day reproducibility was less than 
      10% for glimepiride and less than 5% for pioglitazone, with relative errors 
      ranging from -8.00% to 2.80% at the three concentrations of analytes used for 
      quality control (QC). The matrix effect was negligible and recoveries were 
      similar for each analyte and its IS. Glimepiride and pioglitazone were found to 
      be stable under the assay conditions and the method was successfully applied to 
      the evaluation of pharmacokinetic studies of glimepiride and pioglitazone, 
      following oral doses of 2mg glimepiride tablets and 15 mg pioglitazone tablets to 
      16 healthy volunteers.

TI  - Effect of CYP2C9 genetic polymorphisms on the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of 
      glimepiride in subjects with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 148-54
AB  - Glimepiride, a sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agent, is metabolized by cytochrome P450 
      2C9 (CYP2C9) which is known to have genetic polymorphisms. To examine the effects 
      of CYP2C9 genetic polymorphisms on the safety and efficacy of glimepiride in 
      patients with type 2 diabetes, the responses to the glimepiride were measured in 
      Japanese type 2 diabetic patients with the different CYP2C9 genotype. The 
      reduction in the HbA(1c) was significantly larger (P<0.05) among the CYP2C9*1/*3 
      subjects than among the CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects. The long-term observations of 2 
      patients with a CYP2C9*1/*3 suggested that subjects with a CYP2C9*1/*3 respond 
      well to glimepiride during the initial phase of treatment, but 1 patient have 
      shown the weight gain over the long-term treatment. The pharmacokinetic study 
      showed that the area under the concentration-time curve for glimepiride in the 
      CYP2C9*1/*3 subjects was approximately 2.5-fold higher than that of the 
      CYP2C9*1/*1 subjects. The intrinsic clearance of glimepiride by the CYP2C9*3 
      enzyme was lower than that by the CYP2C9*1 enzyme. These results suggested that 
      the lower hydroxylation activity of glimepiride in the subject with type 2 
      diabetes and CYP2C9*1/*3 led to a marked elevation in the plasma concentrations 
      of glimepiride and a stronger pharmacological effect of glimepiride.

      Plasma: Application to a Pharmacokinetic Study in Healthy Volunteers.
PG  - 545-550
LID - 10.1093/chromsci/bmab098 [doi]
AB  - A rapid and sensitive LC-MS/MS method was developed and fully validated for the 
      determination of obeticholic acid in human plasma. Glimepiride was used as 
      internal standard. For this method, liquid-liquid extraction was performed to 
      extract analyte from the plasma samples. Chromatographic separation was performed 
      on a C18 (2.1 × 50 mm, 2.7 μm, Agilent) column with isocratic elution using water 
      containing 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid at a 
      flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The mass detection was performed in negative mode. The 
      precursor-product ion pairs for MRM were m/z 465.3 → 419.3 for obeticholic acid 
      and m/z 489.3 → 224.8 for the IS. The method exhibited great linearity over the 
      concentration range of 0.150-100 ng/mL for obeticholic acid. The sensitivity, 
      linearity, accuracy, precision, recovery, matrix effect and stability of this 
      method were all within the acceptable limits. The method was successfully 
      validated and applied to the pharmacokinetic studies in healthy Chinese 
      volunteers after a single oral dose administration of obeticholic acid tablets of 
      10 mg, and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of obeticholic acid in human were 
      reported for the first time.

      glimepiride/metformin 1/500 mg combination tablet and a sustained-release 
      formulation of glimepiride/metformin 2/500 mg combination tablet in healthy 
      Korean male volunteers: a randomized, 2-sequence, 2-period, 2-treatment crossover 
      study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination of glimepiride and metformin is used for glycemic 
      control in patients with diabetes mellitus. A fixed-dose combination of 
      glimepiride/metformin 2/500 mg slow-release (SR) formulation was developed to 
      improve compliance in polymedicated patients. To accommodate the various dosing 
      regimens of glimepiride, a glimepiride/metformin 1/500 mg SR tablet was also 
      developed. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic 
      properties of SR fixed-dose combinations of glimepiride/metformin 2/500 mg and 
      the newly developed glimepiride/metformin 1/500 mg formulation to meet the 
      regulatory requirements for marketing in Korea. METHODS: An open-label, 
      randomized, 2-treatment, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover study was conducted with 
      healthy male volunteers. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to receive a 
      single dose of glimepiride/metformin 1/500 mg SR (test) or glimepiride/metformin 
      2/500 mg SR (reference) followed by a 1-week washout period and then 
      administration of the alternate treatment. Serial blood samples were collected 
      immediately before and after dosing for 30 hours, and plasma concentrations were 
      determined by using LC-MS/MS with validated methods. Adverse events were assessed 
      by subjects' self-report and interviews addressing general health-related issues. 
      Safety profiles were evaluated throughout the study. RESULTS: Thirty-three 
      subjects were enrolled (mean [SD] age: 27.9 [4.95] years [range, 21-40 years]). 
      Safety profiles were assessed for all 32 subjects who were administered the study 
      drugs, and pharmacokinetic characteristics were evaluated in the 30 subjects who 
      completed the study. The geometric mean ratios (90% CIs) of test to reference for 
      the dose-normalized C(max) and AUC(0-last) of glimepiride were 0.98 (0.90-1.07) 
      and 1.06 (0.98-1.14), respectively. In the case of metformin, the geometric mean 
      ratios (90% CIs) of test to reference for C(max) and AUC(0-last) were 1.06 
      (0.98-1.15) and 1.04 (0.97-1.12), respectively. Nine adverse events were 
      reported. Among them, loose stool, abdominal pain, and headache were considered 
      to be likely related to the study drug. All reported adverse events were mild in 
      intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Dose-proportional characteristics of glimepiride and 
      comparable pharmacokinetic properties of metformin were observed between the SR 
      fixed-dose combinations of glimepiride/metformin 1/500 mg and 2/500 mg. A single 
      dose of either treatment was well tolerated, and the safety profiles of the 2 
      treatments were comparable in this small, selected all-male group of healthy 
      Korean volunteers.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effect of ipragliflozin on the pharmacokinetics of 
      sitagliptin, pioglitazone or glimepiride and vice versa in healthy subjects. 
      METHODS: Three trials with an open-label, randomized, two-way crossover design 
      were conducted in healthy subjects. Ipragliflozin 150 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg, 
      pioglitazone 30 mg or glimepiride 1-2 mg were administered alone or in 
      combination. Primary endpoints were the area under the curve from the time of 
      dosing to infinity (AUC(inf)) and the maximum observed plasma concentration 
      (C(max)) of each drug. RESULTS: Multiple doses of ipragliflozin did not change 
      the AUC(inf) and C(max) of a single dose of sitagliptin, pioglitazone or 
      glimepiride. All geometric mean ratios and 90% CIs for AUC(inf) and C(max) , with 
      and without ipragliflozin, were within the predefined range of 80-125% (AUC(inf)

      105.1 [101.3-109.0], and C(max) : sitagliptin 92.4 [82.8-103.1], pioglitazone 
      98.6 [87.7-110.8], glimepiride 110.0 [101.9-118.8]). Similarly, multiple doses of 
      sitagliptin, pioglitazone or glimepiride did not change the pharmacokinetics of a 
      single dose of ipragliflozin (AUC(inf) : 95.0 [93.4-103.1], 100.0 [98.1-102.0], 
      99.1 [96.6-101.6]; and C(max) : 96.5 [90.4-103.1], 93.5 [86.3-101.2], 97.3 
      [89.2-106.2]). Ipragliflozin either alone or in combination with any of the three 
      glucose-lowering drugs was well tolerated in healthy subjects. CONCLUSION: 
      Ipragliflozin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin, pioglitazone or 
      glimepiride and vice versa, suggesting that no dose-adjustments are likely to be 
      required when ipragliflozin is given in combination with other glucose-lowering 
      drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling of the effects of glimepiride on 
      insulin secretion and glucose lowering in healthy humans.
PG  - 469-76
AB  - Glimepiride is an oral sulfonylurea antihyperglycaemic agent. We used 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modelling to analyse the relationship 
      between plasma glimepiride concentration, insulin secretion and glucose lowering 
      to determine the effects of the drug in healthy volunteers. A single 2-mg oral 
      dose of glimepiride was administered to six healthy volunteers. The control group 
      received a placebo. All subjects consumed 12 g of sugar immediately after drug 
      administration in order to standardize the initial plasma glucose levels. Serial 
      blood sampling was performed for 9 h after oral dosing. Plasma glimepiride, 
      insulin and glucose levels were determined by validated methods (LC/MS/MS assay, 
      hexokinase method and radioimmunoassay respectively). Time courses of plasma 
      glimepiride concentration, insulin secretion, and glucose lowering effects were 
      analysed by means of PK-PD modelling with the ADAPT II program. The time course 
      of the plasma concentrations followed a two-compartmental model with a lag time. 
      The glimepiride concentration peaked at 191.5 ng/mL at approximately 4 h after 
      administration. The maximal increase in insulin secretion was 9.98 mIU/L and the 
      maximal decrease in plasma glucose was 19.33 mg/dL. Both peak effects occurred at 
      approximately 2.5 h after drug intake. The glucose disappearance model was used 
      to analyse glimepiride's insulin secretion and glucose lowering effects. The 
      PK-PD model described well the relationship between plasma glimepiride and its 
      insulin secretion and hypoglycaemic effects in healthy volunteers.

PG  - 341-57
AB  - Twelve healthy fasting male volunteers received glimepiride in 1, 2, 4 or 8 mg 
      single oral doses. On the days when glimepiride was taken, the subjects were 
      given a standardised carbohydrate diet (18 bread exchange units) and drank 125 ml 
      of water hourly. Blood and urine samples were taken before drug administration 
      and afterwards for up to 36 hours (blood) and 48 hours (urine) to determine serum 
      and urinary concentrations of glimepiride and its hydroxy- and 
      carboxy-metabolites (M1 and M2). The areas under the curve for glimepiride after 
      oral doses of 1 to 8 mg and the urinary recovery of its metabolites M1 and M2 
      were dose linear. All confidence intervals were well contained within the 
      bioequivalence range of 80-125%. There was a statistically significant difference 
      for Cmax values of glimepiride between doses after dose normalisation. A 
      dose-dependent increase for Cmax was nevertheless clearly observed with a 
      correlation coefficient of r=0.90. The pharmacokinetics of glimepiride are dose 
      linear in the dose range 1 to 8 mg, and glimepiride was safe and well tolerated 
      in healthy volunteers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Implementation of a new pharmaceutical technique to improve aqueous 
      solubility and thus dissolution, enhancement of drug permeation, and finally 
      formulation of a controlled release tablet loaded with glimepiride (GLMP). 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Improve GLMP bioavailability and pharmacokinetics in type II 
      diabetic patients. METHODS: Different polymers were used to enhance aqueous GLMP 
      solubility of which a saturated polymeric drug solution was prepared and 
      physically adsorbed onto silica. An experimental design was employed to optimize 
      the formulation parameters affecting the preparation of GLMP matrix tablets. A 
      compatibility study was conducted to study components interactions. Scanning 
      electron microscope (SEM) was performed before and after the tablets were placed 
      in the dissolution medium. An in vivo study in human volunteers was performed 
      with the optimized GLMP tablets, which were compared to pure and marketed drug 
      products. RESULTS: Enhancement of GLMP aqueous solubility, using the polymeric 
      drug solution technique, by more than 6-7 times when compared with the binary 
      system. All the studied formulation factors significantly affected the studied 
      variables. No significant interaction was detected among components. SEM 
      illustrated the surface and inner tablet structure, and confirmed the drug 
      release which was attributed to diffusion mechanism. The volunteer group 
      administered the optimized GLMP tablet exhibited higher drug plasma concentration 
      (147.4 ng/mL), longer time to reach maximum plasma concentration (4 h) and longer 
      t(1/2) (7.236 h) compared to other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Matrix tablet loaded with 
      a physically modified drug form could represent a key solution for drugs with 
      inconsistent dissolution and absorption profiles.

TI  - In vivo and In vitro Drug Interactions Study of Glimepride with Atorvastatin and 
      Rosuvastatin.
PG  - 196-200
LID - 10.4103/0975-1483.63169 [doi]
AB  - Aim of this investigation was to study the in vivo and in vitro drug interaction 
      of glimepride with atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. In vitro drug interaction of 
      glimepride with atorvastatin and rosuvastatin was studied using human pooled 
      liver microsomes and evaluated using high performance liquid chromatography. In 
      vivo pharmacokinetic drug interaction of glimepride (6 mg/kg) in coadministration 
      with atorvastatin (60 mg/kg) and rosuvastatin (60 mg/kg) were studied in rats and 
      analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In in 
      vitro study, atorvastatin decreased its own metabolism as well as the metabolism 
      of glimepiride. Rosuvastatin coadministration with glimepride reduced the 
      metabolism of glimepride and increased the metabolism of its own. In in vivo 
      study, concentration in plasma, C(max), AUC((0-t)) and AUC((0-∞)) (area under the 
      concentration-time curve, AUC) of glimepride was increased significantly in 
      coadministration with atorvastatin whereas there was no significant change was 
      observed in the case of coadministration with rosuvastatin. Half life (T(1/2)) 
      and volume of distribution (V(d)) of glimepride decreased significantly with both 
      atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. Elimination rate constant, K(el) of glimepride 
      increased significantly with both atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. Clearance (Cl) 
      of glimepride decreased significantly but the decrease was more with atorvastatin 
      than with rosuvastatin. It is concluded that glimepride metabolism is little 
      affected by rosuvastatin in vitro, which agreed with the negligible interaction 
      in in vivo study. Thus, from safety point of view rosuvastatin is better to 
      prescribe as a coadministration therapy with glimepiride. On the other hand, 
      atorvastatin could cause an increase in the bioavailability of glimepride per 
      oral and also significantly decrease the metabolism of glimerpride in in vitro 
      study. This may pose a positive implication in clinical practice.

TI  - Novel liquid chromatographic method for simultaneous estimation of pioglitazone 
      and glimepiride in rat plasma by solid phase extraction: application to 
      preclinical pharmacokinetic studies.
PG  - 23-31
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1296164 [doi]
AB  - The need for a reliable bioanalytical method is of primary importance during 
      preclinical studies. The aim of the present study was simultaneous determination 
      of pioglitazone (CAS 111025-46-8) (PIO) and glimepiride (CAS 93479-97-1) (GLM) in 
      plasma of rats. A high-performance liquid chromatographic method has been 
      developed and validated using C18 column and UV detector. A mobile phase composed 
      of acetonitrile and ammonium acetate buffer pH 4.5 in the ratio of 55:45%. The 
      plasma samples clean-up was carried out using solid phase cartridges. The method 
      was in the linear range of 50-8000 ng/mL for PIO and 50-2000 ng/mL for GLM. The 
      coefficient of regression was found to be > or = 0.99. Precision and accuracy 
      were within the acceptable limits, as indicated by relative standard deviation 
      varying from 1.5 to 6.1% for PIO and 3.1 to 7.0% for GLM whereas the accuracy 
      ranged from 97.0 to 106.4% for PIO and 96.5 to 106.4% for GLM. The mean 
      extraction recovery was found to be 90.2 +/- 4.5, 76.8 +/- 2.8 and 85.2 +/- 5.2% 
      for PIO, GLM and internal standard, respectively. Moreover, PIO and GLM were 
      stable in plasma, up to 30 days of storage at -70 degrees C and after being 
      subjected to bench top, auto-sampler, and three freeze-thaw cycles. The developed 
      method was applied for preclinical pharmacokinetic studies.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic interactions between glimepiride and rosuvastatin in healthy 
      Korean subjects: does the SLCO1B1 or CYP2C9 genetic polymorphism affect these 
      drug interactions?
PG  - 503-512
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S129586 [doi]
AB  - To improve cardiovascular outcomes, dyslipidemia in patients with diabetes needs 
      to be treated. Thus, these patients are likely to take glimepiride and 
      rosuvastatin concomitantly. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions between these two drugs in healthy males and to 
      explore the effect of SLCO1B1 and CYP2C9 polymorphisms on their interactions in 
      two randomized, open-label crossover studies. Glimepiride was studied in part 1 
      and rosuvastatin in part 2. Twenty-four participants were randomly assigned to 
      each part. All subjects (n=24) completed part 1, and 22 subjects completed part 
      2. A total of 38 subjects among the participants of the PK interaction studies 
      were enrolled in the genotype study to analyze their SLCO1B1 and CYP2C9 
      polymorphisms retrospectively (n=22 in part 1, n=16 in part 2). Comparison of the 
      PK and safety of each drug alone with those of the drugs in combination showed 
      that both glimepiride and rosuvastatin did not interact with each other and had 
      tolerable safety profiles in all subjects. However, with regard to glimepiride 
      PK, the SLCO1B1 521TC group had a significantly higher maximum plasma 
      concentration (C(max,ss)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve 
      during the dose interval at steady state (AUC(τ,ss)) for glimepiride in 
      combination with rosuvastatin than those for glimepiride alone. However, other 
      significant effects of the SLCO1B1 or CYP2C9 polymorphism on the interaction 
      between the two drugs were not observed. In conclusion, there were no significant 
      PK interactions between the two drugs; however, the exposure to glimepiride could 
      be affected by rosuvastatin in the presence of the SLCO1B1 polymorphism.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the hydroxymetabolite of glimepiride 
      (Amaryl) after intravenous administration.
PG  - 69-85
AB  - Glimepiride is a new sulphonylurea which is eliminated by the formation of a 
      hydroxy-metabolite (hydroxy-gli) and a carboxymetabolite (carboxy-gli). Animal 
      studies have shown hydroxy-gli to exhibit some hypoglycaemic effects while 
      carboxy-gli does not appear to have any pharmacological activity. Pharmacokinetic 
      and pharmacodynamic effects of hydroxy-gli were assessed in humans. 12 healthy 
      male volunteers received an intravenous injection of hydroxy-gli (1.5 mg) or 
      placebo in a single blind, randomised, cross-over study. Samples were collected 
      for up to 24 hours (blood) or 48 hours (urine) following administration of 
      hydroxy-gli or placebo. Hydroxy-gli significantly decreased the minimum serum 
      concentration (Cmin) of glucose by 12% and the average serum glucose 
      concentration over the first four hours of treatment (Cavg0-4) by 9% compared 
      with placebo (P < or = 0.05). In addition, maximum serum C-peptide concentration 
      (Cmax) and Cavg0-4 were both increased by 7% after hydroxy-gli (p < or = 0.05). 
      Serum insulin concentrations (Cmax and Cavg0-4) increased by 4% but the 
      differences from placebo were not statistically significant. No adverse events 
      were reported during the study. In conclusion, the hydroxymetabolite of 
      glimepiride shows pharmacological activity in human subjects.

AB  - A simple and sensitive method was developed for simultaneous estimation of 
      Glimepiride (GLIM) and Sildenafil citrate (SIL) in rat Plasma by reverse phase 
      high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The drug samples were extracted 
      by liquid-liquid extraction with 300 µl of acetonitrile and 5 ml of diethyl 
      ether. Chromatographic separation was achieved on C18 column using methanol: 
      water (85:15 v/v) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and UV detection at 
      230 nm. The retention time of GLIM and SIL was found to be 2.5 and 4.0 min 
      respectively with total run time of 7 min. The developed method was validated for 
      accuracy, precision, linearity and recovery. The method was linear and found to 
      be acceptable over the range of 100-12 000 ng/ml. The method was successfully 
      applied for the analysis of rat plasma sample for application to pharmacokinetic.

AB  - A sensitive and rapid ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
      spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed to determine bosentan (BOS) and 
      glimepiride (GPD) in human plasma simultaneously. Chromatographic separation was 
      carried out on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column and mass spectrometric analysis was 
      performed using a QTrap5500 mass spectrometer coupled with an electro-spray 
      ionization (ESI) source in the positive ion mode. The MRM transitions of m/z 
      552.0→202.1 and m/z 491.2→125.9 were used to quantify BOS and GPD, respectively. 
      This assay method has been fully validated in terms of selectivity, linearity, 
      recovery and matrix effect, accuracy, precision and stability. The linearity of 
      this method was found to be within the concentration range of 5-1000 ng/mL for 
      BOS, and 2.5-500 ng/mL for GPD in human plasma. Only 1.5 min was needed for an 
      analytical run. This assay was used to support a clinical study where multiple 
      oral doses were administered to healthy Chinese subjects to investigate the 
      pharmacokinetics of BOS and GPD.

AB  - Glimepiride (GLI) is prescribed for the management of type-2 diabetes where as 
      pitavastatin (PIT) for the treatment of diabetes associated dyslipidemia. Both 
      the drugs are metabolized by CYP2C9 and have the potential of altering the enzyme 
      through either inhibition or induction. In this respect, we present a simple, 
      fast and validated bioanalytical LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous estimation 
      of GLI and PIT from rat plasma. Waters XTerra RP HPLC column (4.6×100mm, 5μm) 
      with mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 10mM ammonium acetate (pH-6.0) 
      in the ratio 85:15 (v/v) at a flow rate of 1mL/min was used for the 
      chromatographic separation. The negative ionization mode with MRM transitions: 
      m/z 420.17→288.13 for PIT, m/z 489.59→350.12 for GLI and m/z 380.08→316.31for 
      celecoxib as internal standard (IS). A total run time of 3min and LLOQ was found 
      to be 5ng/mL for both PIT and GLI. The method was applied to study the drug 
      interaction between GLI and PIT in rat liver microsomes. In vivo rat 
      pharmacokinetics study showed there was a 1.29-fold increase in AUC(0-∞) and 
      1.2-fold decrease in the clearance of PIT in presence of GLI. No notable 
      difference in the pharmacokinetic profile of GLI was observed upon the 
      intravenous co-administration of PIT.

TI  - Bioequivalence and pharmacokinetic evaluation of two formulations of glimepiride 
      2 mg: a single-dose, randomized-sequence, open-label, two-way crossover study in 
      healthy Chinese male volunteers.
PG  - 986-95

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glimepiride is an oral sulfonylurea antihyperglycemic agent indicated 
      for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although there are reports in the 
      literature regarding the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of glimepiride, few 
      data of PK parameters are available in a Chinese population; none are available 
      regarding a recently developed generic formulation. OBJECTIVE: To meet the 
      requirements for marketing a new generic product in China, the study was designed 
      to compare the PK properties and bioequivalence of 2-mg tablets of glimepiride: 
      the newly developed generic formulation (test) and a branded formulation 
      (reference) in healthy Chinese male volunteers. METHODS: A single-dose, 
      randomized-sequence, open-label, 2-way crossover study was conducted in fasted 
      healthy Chinese male volunteers. Eligible participants were randomly assigned in 
      a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 tablet (2 mg each) of the test or reference formulation, 
      followed by a 1-week washout period and administration of the alternate 
      formulation. The study drugs were administered after a 10-hour overnight fast. 
      Plasma samples were collected before study drug administration (baseline) and at 
      0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, and 48 hours after study drug 
      administration. Concentrations in plasma of the parent glimepiride and its M1 
      metabolite were analyzed with a LC-MS/MS method. The formulations were considered 
      bioequivalent if the 90% CIs for the log-transformed values were within the 
      predetermined equivalence range (70%-143% for C(max) and 80%-125% for AUC), 
      according to the guidelines of the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) of 
      China. Tolerability was based on the recording of adverse events (AEs), 
      monitoring vital signs, ECGs, and laboratory tests at baseline and completion of 
      the study. RESULTS: A total of 24 healthy Chinese male volunteers were enrolled 
      and completed the study; however, only the data from 23 subjects were included 
      (mean [SD] age, 23.6 [2.2] years [range, 18.6-26.9 years]; weight, 64.0 [8.4] kg 
      [range, 52.0-82.0 kg]; and height, 172.3 [5.6] cm [range, 164.0-185.0 cm) in the 
      PK and tolerability assessments due to a violation of the protocol. For parent 
      glimepiride, the 90% CIs for the ratios of Cmax, AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-infinity) 
      were 93.83% to 115.19%, 90.82% to 102.29%, and 92.22% to 103.78%, respectively. 
      For the M1 metabolite, the 90% CIs were 91.71% to 110.79%, 91.33% to 101.76%, and 
      89.99% to 99.85%. Both met the predetermined criteria for bioequivalence. Four 
      AEs (17.4%) were reported: hypertriglyceridemia (2 subjects [8.7%]; 1 each 
      receiving the test and reference formulations); increase of red blood cells in 
      urine (1 subject [4.3%] receiving the reference formulation); and hypoglycemia (1 
      subject [4.3%] receiving the test formulation). The incidence of hypoglycemia was 
      the only AE considered probably related to study drug administration; all others 
      were considered probably not related. All AEs were transient and considered by 
      the investigators to be mild. CONCLUSIONS: In this small study in fasted healthy 
      Chinese male volunteers, a single 2-mg dose of the test formulation met the 
      regulatory criteria to assume bioequivalence to the reference formulation based 
      on the rate and extent of absorption. Both formulations were well tolerated. SFDA 
      Registration No.: 2009L01033.

TI  - Effect of Piperazine Dithioctate on the Oral Pharmacokinetics of Glimepiride in 
      Rats.
PG  - 1161-8
LID - 10.1248/bpb.b15-00044 [doi]
AB  - The objective of the present work was to investigate the potential for 
      pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between glimepiride (GMP) and piperazine 
      dithioctate (PDT) in rats to support the development of an orally combined 
      product of the two drugs. An LC-MS/MS bioanalytical method was developed for 
      simultaneous quantification of GMP and thioctic acid (TA) in rat plasma. The 
      accuracy, precision, linearity, selectivity, and recovery were all within an 
      acceptable range. The oral plasma exposure of the GMP solution was more than 
      14-times greater than that of the GMP suspension at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, 
      suggesting a dissolution-limited absorption of the GMP suspension. Oral 
      co-administration of PDT (72 mg/kg) with GMP suspension (0.5 mg/kg) reduced the 
      plasma GMP exposure by approximately 80% without a significant change in t1/2 and 
      tmax. Oral co-administration of PDT with GMP solution had no significant effect 
      on the plasma pharmacokinetics of GMP. PDT lowered the pH (from ca. 7 to 5.6) and 
      the dissolved GMP concentration in the GMP suspension. It was also shown that GMP 
      was more soluble at pH 7 than at 5.7 in an aqueous solution, and the oral plasma 
      exposure of a GMP suspension at pH 7.0 was substantially higher than that of a 
      suspension at pH 5.7. These results suggest that the pH-dependent solubility of 
      GMP was likely responsible for PDT's effect on the oral absorption of GMP. In 
      conclusion, the current work suggests a possibility of drug-drug interaction 
      between GMP and PDT upon oral co-administration.

TI  - Strategies to improve dissolution and oral absorption of glimepiride tablets: 
      solid dispersion versus micronization techniques.
PG  - 727-36
LID - 10.3109/03639045.2010.538061 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study is to compare two different dissolution-enhancing 
      strategies, solid dispersion (SD) and micronized techniques, for improving oral 
      absorption of poorly soluble glimepiride, and to decide which strategy is 
      suitable for its solubilization. The formulation of glimepiride SD was prepared 
      by a solvent-evaporation process with povidone k-30 (PVPk30) at a weight ratio of 
      1:9 (drug:carrier). The other was prepared via a modified micronization 
      technique, where glimepiride was premilled together with lactose and Lutrol F68 
      until the milled material passes through a 500 mesh ASTM sieve (30 μm). The 
      dissolution results indicated that the two techniques were both capable of 
      enhancing the dissolution rate and extent of glimepiride. The release profiles of 
      the two prepared products were similar to the marketed product (Amaryl®) in 
      various types of dissolution media. Furthermore, the oral bioavailability was 
      evaluated for the three formulations in fasted beagle dogs. Statistical analysis 
      indicated that there were no significant differences in pharmacokinetic 
      parameters among the two prepared formulations and a marketed product, especially 
      for AUC₀₋₃₆, C(max), and T(max). The dissolution parameters (D₁₀ and AUC₀₋₂₀) in 
      Tris buffer demonstrated the good in vitro/in vivo relationship with T(max) 
      values for the three formulations. In conclusion, our studies confirmed that both 
      SD and micronization techniques were capable of improving dissolution and oral 
      absorption of glimepiride tablets to a similar extent as the marketed product, 
      and the three glimepiride tablets were bioequivalent in the case of the rate and 
      extent of absorption in dogs.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo drug-drug interaction of losartan and glimepiride in rats 
      and its possible mechanism.
PG  - 133-8
LID - 10.1159/000377637 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Losartan and glimepiride are commonly used drugs to treat chronic 
      diseases of hypertension and diabetes; they are both substrates of CYP2C9. The 
      aim of the present study was to investigate the possible interaction of losartan 
      and glimepiride both in vitro (rat liver microsomes) and in vivo (healthy 
      Sprague-Dawley rats). METHODS: In rat liver microsomes, 1-10 μmol/l losartan and 
      glimepiride were coincubated, and the inhibitory effect was analyzed. In the 
      subsequent pharmacokinetic study, 15 healthy Sprague-Dawley rats received 
      administrations of 5 mg/kg losartan or 1 mg/kg glimepiride or a coadministration. 
      RESULTS: In the rat liver microsome system, glimepiride showed a slight 
      inhibition of losartan at concentrations of 1-10 μmol/l, whereas losartan 
      exhibited no inhibitory effect on glimepiride. In vivo, glimepiride did not 
      modify the plasma concentration of losartan and its metabolite E-3174. The 
      alteration of an increased AUC and Cmax was observed in the pharmacokinetic 
      parameters of glimepiride and hydroxy glimepiride. CONCLUSIONS: Glimepiride did 
      not affect losartan pharmacokinetics in rats, while losartan potently altered 
      glimepiride metabolism; this result was inconsistent with the in vitro outcome. 
      The mechanism requires further investigation. In clinical settings, attention 
      should be paid to the interaction of these two drugs in the human body as well as 
      the possible adverse reactions of glimepiride.

TI  - Frequency of CYP2C9 variant alleles, including CYP2C9*13 in a Korean population 
      and effect on glimepiride pharmacokinetics.
PG  - 105-11
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2710.2010.01238.x [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 is a clinically important 
      enzyme involved in the metabolism of many drugs commonly used in humans. Of 
      several allelic variants known to affect the catalytic activity of the CYP2C9 
      enzyme, the frequencies of the CYP2C9*3 and CYP2C9*13 alleles in the Korean 
      population have been reported as 1·1% and 0·6%, respectively. Our objective was 
      to re-evaluate the frequencies of CYP2C9 allelic variants in the Korean 
      population, including the CYP2C9*13 allele by pyrosequencing, and to investigate 
      the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride in relation to CYP2C9 genotypes, including 
      CYP2C9*3/*3. METHODS: 295 subjects were genotyped for CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 using 
      the TaqMan procedure, and for CYP2C9*13 using pyrosequencing. These data were 
      combined with our previously reported data to assess the CYP2C9 allele and 
      genotype frequencies in 869 Korean subjects. Data from 24 of the 295 genotyped 
      subjects (22 CYP2C9*1/*1 homozygotes, one CYP2C9*1/*3 heterozygote and one 
      CYP2C9*3/*3 homozygote) who had participated in a bioequivalence study were 
      analysed retrospectively to examine the effects of CYP2C9 genotype on glimepiride 
      pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: The frequencies of the CYP2C9*1/*3, *3/*3, and *1/*13 
      genotypes in the study population (n = 295) were 0·081 (n = 24), 0·010 (n = 3) 
      and 0·003 (n = 1), respectively. In the 869 subjects from the combined studies, 
      allele frequencies for CYP2C9*3 and CYP2C9*13 were 0·025 (95% CI: 0·018, 0·033) 
      and 0·002 (95% CI: 0·000, 0·010), respectively. Relative to CYP2C9*1 homozygotes, 
      the one CYP2C9*3 homozygous subject was found to have a higher AUC(0-∞) value 
      (490% of the reference value) and a lower oral clearance rate (18% of the 
      reference). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This study is the first examination of 
      CYP2C9*3 homozygotes in the Korean population. Our data on the one subject with 
      this genotype suggest that CYP2C9*3/*3 momozygotes have lower clearance of 
      glimepiride and are exposed to higher levels of the drug than wild-type 
      homozygotes. Although we identified a subject with the CYP2C9*13 allele using a 
      new pyrosequencing assay, we were unfortunately unable to investigate its effects 
      on glimepiride pharmacokinetics.

TI  - Bioequivalence evaluation of two brands of glimepiride 4 mg tablets in healthy 
      subjects.
PG  - 203-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper describes a bioequivalence study with two oral glimepiride 
      (4 mg) tablets formulations. The reference preparation was Solosa/Aventis 
      Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA, and the test preparation was Glimepiride/Specifar, 
      Athens, Greece. SUBJECTS, MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study design was open, 
      randomized, two-period, two-sequence, two-treatment with crossover involving 24 
      healthy male and female subjects. All subjects completed the study. Glimepiride 
      plasma concentrations were measured utilizing a sensitive, reproducible and 
      accurate HPLC method. Pharmacokinetic parameters used to assess bioequivalence 
      were AUC(0_last), AUC(0-inf) for the extent of absorption and Cmax and tmax for 
      the rate of absorption. Statistical evaluation of Cmax, AUC(0_last), and 
      AUC(0-inf) was done after semilogarithmic transformation using a two-way analysis 
      of variance (ANOVA). Tmax values were tested using the distribution-free 
      Hodges-Lehman interval. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The parametric 90% confidence 
      intervals for ratio T/R ranged from 90.60-108.00% (point estimate 98.90%) for 
      AUC(0-last), 90.70-107.90% (point estimate 98.90%) for AUC(0-inf) and 
      86.70-103.70% (point estimate 94.80%) for Cmax, respectively. Based on the 
      results of tmax, Kel and t(1/2), there were no statistically significant 
      differences and the two glimepiride preparations are equivalent with respect to 
      rate and extent of absorption as defined by the European Union bioequivalence 
      requirements.

TI  - Fabrication and characterization of glimepiride nanosuspension by 
      ultrasonication-assisted precipitation for improvement of oral bioavailability 
      and in vitro α-glucosidase inhibition.
PG  - 6287-6296
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S210548 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We aimed to enhance the solubility, dissolution rate, oral 
      bioavailability, and α-glucosidase inhibition of glimepiride (Glm) by fabricating 
      its nanosuspension using a precipitation-ultrasonication approach. METHODS: Glm 
      nanosuspensions were fabricated using optimized processing conditions. 
      Characterization of Glm was performed using Malvern Zetasizer, scanning electron 
      microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, 
      and powder X-ray diffraction. Minimum particle size and polydispersity index 
      (PDI) values were found to be 152.4±2.42 nm and 0.23±0.01, respectively, using 
      hydroxypropyl methylcellulose: 6 cPs, 1% w/v, polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 1% w/v, 
      and sodium lauryl sulfate 0.12% w/v, keeping ultrasonication power input at 400 
      W, with 15 minutes' processing at 3-second pauses. In vivo oral bioavailability 
      was assessed using rabbits as a model. RESULTS: The saturation solubility of the 
      Glm nanosuspensions was substantially enhanced 3.14-fold and 5.77-fold compared 
      to unprocessed drug in stabilizer solution and unprocessed active pharmaceutical 
      ingredient. Also, the dissolution rate of the nanosuspensions ws substantially 
      boosted when compared to the marketed formulation and unprocessed drug candidate. 
      The results showed that >85% of Glm nanosuspensions dissolved in the first 10 
      minutes compared to 10.17% of unprocessed Glm), 42.19% of microsuspensions, and 
      19.94% of marketed tablets. In-vivo studies conducted in animals, i.e. rabbits, 
      demonstrated that maximum concentration and AUC(0-24) with oral dosing were 
      twofold (5 mg/kg) and 1.74-fold (2.5 mg/kg) and 1.80-fold (5 mg/kg) and 1.63-fold 
      (2.5 mg/kg), respectively, and compared with the unprocessed drug formulation. 
      In-vitro α-glucosidase inhibition results showed that fabricated nanosuspensions 
      had a pronounced effect compared to unprocessed drug. CONCLUSION: The optimized 
      batch fabricated by ultrasonication-assisted precipitation can be useful in 
      boosting oral bioavailability, which may be accredited to enhanced solubility and 
      dissolution rate of Glm, ultimately resulting in its faster rate of absorption 
      due to nanonization.

AB  - Glimepiride (GLIM) is used as an oral antihyperglycemic agent for treatment of 
      type 2 diabetes. The drug presents two polymorphic forms (GLIM form I and GLIM 
      form II) described in the literature, and according to in vitro data, GLIM form 
      II is about 3.5 times more soluble and releases 2 times the drug amount than GLIM 
      form I in the physiological pH range. Considering the literature in vitro data 
      and that the diabetes treatment demands glycemic control, avoiding abrupt 
      fluctuations in the blood glucose levels, this work aimed to study the impact of 
      GLIM polymorphism in the in vivo performance of GLIM solid oral dosages. For 
      this, hard gelatin capsules with GLIM form I or II were prepared and orally 
      administered in rats. After that, pharmacokinetic studies were performed by 
      sampling animal blood at different times, and biochemical parameters 
      (pharmacodynamic), such as glucose and insulin, were also evaluated. Our results 
      showed that the in vitro data corroborate with our in vivo assays. GLIM form II 
      provided higher plasma concentration of drug than form I (at baseline up to 
      approximately 200 min after oral administration) and, consequently, increased 
      insulin release and reduced levels of glucose, showing good correlation between 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics assays. Thus, this study demonstrated that 
      GLIM polymorphs in oral dosages might alter the drug efficacy, which may expose 
      the patients to risks, such as hypoglycemia.

TI  - Therapeutic effect of atorvastatin on kidney functions and urinary excretion of 
      Glimepiride in healthy adult human male subjects.
PG  - 2321-2326
AB  - Glimepiride and atorvastatin in combination are commonly employed for treating 
      the hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia, respectively, in patients of type 2 diabetes. 
      The present study was designed to find out the influence of atorvastatin on 
      urinary excretion and renal clearance of Glimepiride in healthy adult male 
      volunteers. In each experimental subject, Glimepiride 2mg was given orally after 
      an overnight fasting. Samples of blood and urine were taken at different specific 
      time intervals. After a washout period of ten days, Glimepiride 2mg was 
      co-administered with atorvastatin 20mg orally. Post-medication, blood and urine 
      samples were collected following the same sampling schedule as for Glimepiride 
      alone. The samples were analyzed for Glimepiride and creatinine concentration by 
      HPLC-UV and Spectrophotometer, respectively. Mean (±SE) values for blood pH 
      7.445±0.05 and 7.382±0.05, urine pH 4.972±0.08 and 5.08±0.10, diuresis 
      0.0207±0.00 and 0.0237±0.00ml/min/kg, endogenous creatinine in plasma 9.048±0.33 
      and 8.613±0.024µg/ml, endogenous creatinine in urine 512.34±18.20 and 
      556.72±4.60µg/ml, Glimepiride plasma concentration 0.16069±0.00 and 
      0.3227±0.01µg/ml, Glimepiride urine concentration 1.5994±0.03 and 
      0.8665±0.04µg/ml, renal clearance of creatinine 1.224±0.09 and 
      1.550±0.09ml/min/kg, renal clearance of Glimepiride 0.2064±0.01 and 
      0.0641±0.00ml/min/kg and clearance ratio 0.1791±0.01 and 0.0414±0.00 were 
      observed for Glimepiride alone and its concurrent administration with 
      atorvastatin, respectively. Atorvastatin decreased the urinary excretion and 
      renal clearance of Glimepiride due to which chances of hypoglycemia provokes and 
      renal handling of Glimepiride involves back diffusion besides glomerular 
      filtration and no influence of atorvastatin was seen on these mechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS: Glimepiride is a commonly used sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agent. 
      There is considerable interindividual variation in the response to sulfonylurea 
      for patients with type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to investigate 
      whether genetic variations influence the efficacy of glimepiride in healthy 
      Korean subjects. METHODS: A single 2-mg oral dose of glimepiride was administered 
      to 46 healthy volunteers. Serial blood sampling for 12h after oral dosing was 
      performed for determination of plasma glimepiride, glucose and insulin levels. We 
      tested the association of seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four 
      candidate genes with the efficacy of glimepiride. RESULTS: Pharmacodynamic 
      profiles for plasma glucose and insulin showed no statistically significant 
      differences among genotype groups, and parameters were not different from one 
      another. There were no association of the KCNJ11, NOS1AP, TCF7L2 and ABCC8 gene 
      polymorphisms and the efficacy of glimepiride. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of these 
      polymorphisms provides no clinical useful information for the pharmacogenetic 
      therapeutic approach for Korean patients with type 2 diabetes.

TI  - [Preparation and evaluation in vivo and in vitro of glimepiride gel-matrix 
      controlled-release patch].
PG  - 640-4
AB  - AIM: To study the pharmaceutical characterization, the pharmacokinetics and 
      relative bioavailability of glimepiride gel-matrix controlled-release patch in 
      rats. METHODS: An HPLC method was established for the determination of 
      glimepiride in the permeation receptor and patch. The permeation rate and 
      penetration mechanism of glimepiride-TDDS through rabbit skin in vitro was 
      examined. The determination of drug content and the examination of weight 
      difference and stability of the glimepiride-TDDS were carried out. Another HPLC 
      method after pre-column derivatization was developed to determine the glimepiride 
      serum concentration and then employed to study the pharmacokinetics and relative 
      bioavailability of glimepiride after a single dose of oral or patch 
      administration in rats. RESULTS: The permeation tests through excised rabbit skin 
      demonstrated that the optimized glimepiride controlled-release patch exhibited 
      zero-order kinetic characteristics that satisfied the demands of original design. 
      The determination of glimepiride content and the quality control of weight 
      difference of the patch accorded with Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of 
      China of 2000 edition and the pharmaceutical characterization showed good 
      stability. The HPLC method for the determination of serum glimepiride was shown 
      to be a sensitive and simple one. The pharmacokinetic results showed that TDDS 
      could decrease the maximum serum concentration, prolong the peak time, extend the 
      MRT by 5.5 times compared with oral administration and maintain the serum 
      concentration of glimepiride at a higher level even after 120 h of 
      administration. The relative bioavailability of glimepiride-TDDS was 20.3% versus 
      oral administration. CONCLUSION: The glimepiride-TDDS showed a slower, longer and 
      smoother serum concentration-time profile, as compared with conventional oral 
      administration in both absorption and elimination phase. As a result, it was 
      evident that the patch exhibited good controlled-release properties.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic comparison of a new glimepiride 1-mg + metformin 500-mg 
      combination tablet formulation and a glimepiride 2-mg + metformin 500-mg 
      combination tablet formulation: a single-dose, randomized, open-label, 
      two-period, two-way crossover study in healthy, fasting Korean male volunteers.
PG  - 2755-64

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coadministration of glimepiride and metformin has been used to 
      achieve glucose control. Because compliance with a multiple medication regimen 
      can be difficult for some patients, combination tablets of glimepiride + 
      metformin might be a suitable alternative for these patients. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study was conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics of test and reference 
      formulations of glimepiride + metformin fixed-dose combination tablets under 
      fasting conditions to meet the regulatory requirements for marketing approval of 
      a new drug in Korea. METHODS: This was a single-dose, randomized, open-label, 
      2-period, 2-way crossover study conducted between March 2007 and May 2007. 
      Healthy fasting Korean men were randomized to 1 of 2 dosing sequences: a single 
      oral administration of a fixed-dose glimepiride 1-mg + metformin 500-mg 
      combination tablet (test) followed by single oral administration of a fixed-dose 
      glimepiride 2 mg + metformin 500 mg combination tablet (reference), separated by 
      a 1-week washout period between doses; or a single oral administration of a 
      fixed-dose glimepiride 2-mg + metformin 500-mg combination tablet followed by 
      single oral administration of a fixed-dose glimepiride 1 mg + metformin 500-mg 
      combination tablet, separated by a 1-week washout period between doses. Serial 
      samples of blood were collected up to 24 hours after oral administration, and 
      drug concentrations in plasma were determined by HPLC-MS/MS. Tolerability was 
      assessed based on adverse events and changes in clinical parameters. Serious 
      adverse events included those that resulted in death, a life-threatening 
      condition, congenital anomaly or birth defect, or required hospitalization or 
      prolongation of existing hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 30 healthy male 
      subjects (mean age, 25.6 years [range, 20-36 years]; weight, 69.5 kg [range, 
      58.2-90.7 kg]) participated in the study. After administration of the test and 
      reference formulations, glimepiride was rapidly absorbed, reaching C(max) with a 
      median T(max) of 1.75 and 2.0 hours, respectively, and then declined 
      exponentially with an average t(1/2) of 8.2 and 8.5 hours. The individual C(max) 
      and AUC(last) of glimepiride were observed to be proportionally increased 
      according to the administered glimepiride dose. The mean (SD) dose-normalized 
      Cmax values of glimepiride 1 and 2 mg were 168.2 (54.9) and 149.9 (47.4) 
      ng/mL/mg, respectively; the mean dose-normalized AUC(last) values of glimepiride 
      1 and 2 mg were 681.5 (190.3) and 635.8 (194.1) ng x h/mL/mg. Individual plots of 
      dose-normalized C(max) and AUC(last) values identified a similarity between the 2 
      groups but no significant between-group differences. A total of 25 adverse events 
      (12 after the test dose and 13 after the reference dose) were reported by 13 of 
      the 30 subjects. All adverse events were considered mild. Twenty-one adverse 
      events were considered related to the study drug (8 after the test dose and 13 
      after the reference dose). Adverse events believed to be related to the test 
      formulation were diarrhea (4 cases), dizziness (1), headache (1), tingling 
      sensation (1), and weakness (1). Adverse events believed to be related to the 
      reference formulation were diarrhea (6 cases), headache (3), cold sweats (1), 
      dyspepsia (1), epigastric discomfort (1), and lethargy (1). There were no 
      clinically significant findings in the laboratory test results or vital sign 
      monitoring during the study. There were no serious adverse events reported. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The C(max) and AUC(last) of glimepiride increased proportionally 
      according to the administered glimepiride dose in this study of healthy, fasting 
      Korean men. The safety profiles of the 2 combination tablets were comparable.

TI  - Development of a rapid method for the determination of glimepiride in human 
      plasma using liquid-liquid extraction based on 96-well format micro-tubes and 
      liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.
PG  - 2055-61
AB  - A semi-automated liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method 
      was developed for the determination of glimepiride in human plasma. The plasma 
      samples were treated by liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) in 1.2 mL 96-well format 
      micro-tubes. Glimepiride and the internal standard (IS) glibenclamide were 
      extracted from human plasma by LLE, using a mixture of ethyl acetate/diethyl 
      ether 50:50 (v/v) as the organic solvent. After vortexing, centrifugation and 
      freezing, the supernatant organic solvent was evaporated. The analyte and IS were 
      dissolved in a small volume of a reconstitution solution, an aliquot of which was 
      analyzed by reversed-phase LC/MS/MS with positive ion electrospray ionization, 
      using multiple reaction monitoring. The method proved to be sensitive and 
      specific for both drugs, and statistical evaluation revealed excellent linearity 
      for the range of concentrations 2.0-500.0 ng/mL with very good accuracy and 
      inter- and intra-day precisions. The proposed method enabled the rapid and 
      reliable determination of glimepiride in pharmacokinetic or bioequivalence 
      studies after per os administration of a 3 or 4 mg tablet of glimepiride.

TI  - Simultaneous Determination of Bosentan, Glimepiride, HYBOS and M1 in Rat Plasma 
      by UPLC-MS-MS and its Application to Pharmacokinetic Study.
PG  - 1159-65
LID - 10.1093/chromsci/bmw003 [doi]
AB  - A rapid and sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry (UPLC-MS-MS) method for the simultaneous determination of bosentan 
      (BOS), glimepiride (GLP), hydroxyl bosentan (HYBOS) and hydroxyl glimepiride (M1) 
      in rat plasma using one-step protein precipitation was developed and validated. 
      After addition of ambrisentan as an internal standard (IS), protein precipitation 
      by acetonitrile was used in sample preparation. Chromatographic separation was 
      achieved on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7 μm 
      particle size, Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) and inline 0.2 μm stainless steel 
      frit filter (Waters Corp.) with acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase 
      at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min with gradient elution. The column temperature was 
      maintained at 40°C. Only 4 min was needed for an analytical run. The retention 
      times were ∼3.29 min for BOS, 3.56 min for GLP, 1.42 min for HYBOS, 1.53 min for 
      M1 and 3.22 min for IS. Electrospray ionization source was employed and operated 
      in positive-ion mode; multiple reaction monitoring mode was applied to target 
      fragment ions m/z 552 → 202, m/z 568 → 202, m/z 491 → 352, m/z 507 → 352 and m/z 
      379 → 347 for BOS, HYBOS, GLP, M1 and IS, respectively. The assay was validated 
      over concentration ranges of 25-5,000 ng/mL (r(2) = 0.9984) for BOS, 1-200 ng/mL 
      (r(2) = 0.9999) for GLP, 0.5-100 ng/mL (r(2) = 0.9999) for HYBOS and 0.1-20 ng/mL 
      (r(2) = 0.9984) for M1. Intra- and interday precision values for replicate 
      quality control samples were within 14.2% for all analytes during the assay 
      validation. Mean quality control accuracy values were within -3.3 to 14.4% of 
      nominal values for all analytes. The mean recoveries of BOS, GLP, HYBOS, M1 and 
      ambrisentan from the plasma exceeded 90.4%. The analytes were stable in rat 
      plasma for at least 2 h at room temperature, 30 days at -40°C and following at 
      least three freeze-thaw cycles (-40°C to room temperature). This method was 
      successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of coadministeration of BOS and 
      GLP in rats.

AB  - A simple, rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric 
      (LC-MS/MS) assay method has been developed and fully validated for the 
      simultaneous quantification of atorvastatin, metformin and glimepiride in human 
      plasma. Carbamazepine was used as internal standard (IS). The analytes were 
      extracted from 200 μL aliquots of human plasma via protein precipitation using 
      acetonitrile. The reconstituted samples were chromatographed on a Alltima HP C18 
      column by using a 60:40 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile and 10 mM ammonium acetate 
      (pH 3.0) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.1 mL/min. The calibration curves 
      obtained were linear (r(2) ≥0.99) over the concentration range of 
      0.50-150.03 ng/mL for atorvastatin, 12.14-1207.50 ng/mL for metformin and 
      4.98-494.29 ng/mL for glimepiride. The API-4000 LC-MS/MS in multiple reaction 
      monitoring (MRM) mode was used for detection. The results of the intra- and 
      inter-day precision and accuracy studies were well within the acceptable limits. 
      All the analytes were found to be stable in a battery of stability studies. The 
      method is precise and sensitive enough for its intended purpose. A run time of 
      2.5 min for each sample made it possible to analyze more than 300 plasma samples 
      per day. The developed assay method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic 
      study in human male volunteers.

TI  - Effect of piperine on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glimepiride in 
      normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.
PG  - 1283-6
AB  - The effect of piperine on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
      glimepiride in normal as well as diabetic rats was studied. In normal and 
      streptozotocin induced diabetic rats the combination of glimepiride with piperine 
      increased all the pharmacokinetic parameters, such as Cmax, AUC0-n, AUCtotal, 
      t1/2, and MRT, and decreased the clearance, Vd, markedly as compared with the 
      control group. In pharmacodynamic studies, the combination of glimepiride with 
      piperine provided significant protection against the diabetes induced alterations 
      in the biochemical parameters. In addition, the combination of glimepiride with 
      piperine also improved the total antioxidant status significantly in diabetic 
      rats compared with piperine and glimepiride treated groups. The results revealed 
      that a combination of glimepiride with piperine led to the enhancement of the 
      bioavailability of glimepiride by inhibiting the CYP2C9 enzyme, which suggested 
      that piperine might be beneficial as an adjuvant to glimepiride in a proper dose, 
      in diabetic patients.

AB  - Gymnema sylvestre, important Indian traditional herbal medicine has been used for 
      diabetes from several years and marketed as single or multi-herb formulations 
      globally. People are consuming G. sylvestre along with conventional hypoglycemic 
      drugs. Therefore, there is need of evidence based assessment of risk versus 
      benefits when G. sylvestre co-administered with conventional oral hypoglycemic 
      drugs. In present investigation, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic 
      interactions with oral hypoglycemic drug, glimepiride (GLM) was studied in 
      streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats. A specific and rapid HPLC-ESI-MS/MS 
      method was established for simultaneous quantification of GLM and gymnemagenin 
      (GMG) in rat plasma. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction studies were 
      carried out in STZ induced diabetic rats after concomitant administration of 
      400 mg/kg of G. sylvestre extract and 0.8 mg/kg of GLM for 28 days. The developed 
      HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method was rapid, specific, and precise. Con-comitant oral 
      administration of G. sylvestre extract (400 mg/kg) and GLM (0.8 mg/kg) in 
      diabetic rats for 28 days showed beneficial pharmacodynamic interactions whereas 
      no major alterations in the pharmacokinetics parameters of GLM and GMG were 
      observed. This interaction demonstrated in animal model implies that significant 
      clinical outcome might occur during concomitant administration of G. sylvestre 
      extract and GLM especially in diabetic patients and warrants further studies in 
      the same set up.

PG  - 1005-13
LID - 10.1517/17425247.2014.906402 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To optimize and use of glimepiride (GMD)-loaded self-nanoemulsifying 
      delivery systems (SNEDs) for the preparation of transdermal patches. METHODS: 
      Mixture design was utilized to optimize GMD-loaded SNEDs in acidic and aqueous pH 
      media. Optimized GMD-loaded SNEDs were used in the preparation of chitosan 
      (acidic) and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) (aqueous) films. The prepared 
      optimized formulations were investigated for ex vivo skin permeation, for in vivo 
      hypoglycemic activity and for their pharmacokinetic parameters using animal 
      model. RESULTS: The optimized formulations showed flux value of (2.88 and 4.428 
      μg/cm(2)/h) through rat skin for chitosan and HPMC films, respectively. The 
      pattern of GMD release from both formulations was in favor of Higuchi and 
      approaching zero order models. The n values for Korsmeyer-Peppas equation were 
      characteristic of anomalous (non-Fickian) release mechanism. Moreover, HPMC 
      patches have shown significant reductions (p < 0.05) in blood glucose levels; 
      (213.33 ± 15.19) mg/100 ml from the base-line measurement after 12 h of 
      application. CONCLUSIONS: Optimized GMD SNEDs patches were found to improve GMD 
      skin permeability and the essential pharmacokinetic parameters. Further extensive 
      pre/clinical studies are necessary prior to use transdermal GMD as a valuable 
      alternative to peroral dosage forms with improved bioavailability, longer 
      duration of action and more patient convenience.

TI  - A rapid and highly sensitive method for the determination of glimepiride in human 
      plasma by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry: 
      application to a pre-clinical pharmacokinetic study.
PG  - 58-63
AB  - A sensitive and specific liquid chromatography-positive electrospray 
      ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method has been developed and validated for 
      the determination of glimepiride (GPD) in human plasma. GPD and the internal 
      standard (IS, glibenclamide) were extracted from a small aliquot of human plasma 
      (200 microL) by a simple liquid-liquid extraction technique using ethyl acetate 
      as extraction solvent. The compounds were separated on a YMC Propack, C18, 4.6x50 
      mm column using a mixture of ammonium acetate buffer, acetonitrile and methanol 
      (30:60:10, v/v) as mobile phase at 0.5 mL/min on an API 4000 Sciex mass 
      spectrometer connected to an Agilent HPLC system. Method validation and 
      pre-clinical sample analysis was performed as per FDA guidelines and the results 
      met the acceptance criteria. GPD and IS were detected without any interference 
      from human plasma matrix. The method was proved to be accurate and precise at 
      linearity range of 0.02-100.00 ng/mL with a correlation coefficient of 0.999. The 
      method was robust with a lower limit of quantitation of 0.02 ng/mL. Intra- and 
      inter-day accuracies for GPD were 88.60-113.50 and 96.82-103.93%, respectively. 
      The inter-day precision was better than 12.21%. This method enabled faster and 
      reliable determination of GPD in a pre-clinical study.

TI  - Absence of Drug-Drug Interactions Between Luseogliflozin, a Sodium-Glucose 
      Co-transporter-2 Inhibitor, and Various Oral Antidiabetic Drugs in Healthy 
      Japanese Males.
PG  - 404-17
LID - 10.1007/s12325-015-0209-1 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We investigated the possibilities of drug-drug interactions between 
      luseogliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, and oral 
      antidiabetic drugs (OADs) in healthy Japanese males. METHODS: We conducted six 
      independent studies to investigate potential drug-drug interactions between 5 mg 
      luseogliflozin and the following OADs usually used in Japan: 1 mg glimepiride, 
      250 mg metformin, 30 mg pioglitazone, 50 mg sitagliptin, 50 mg miglitol, or 0.6 
      mg voglibose (0.2 mg before each meal). Twelve subjects were enrolled in each 
      study. The glimepiride, metformin, sitagliptin, and miglitol studies were 
      randomized, open-label, single-dose, three-way crossover studies. The 
      pioglitazone and voglibose studies were open-label studies, where a single dose 
      of luseogliflozin was added to multiple doses of pioglitazone or voglibose. The 
      endpoints were the area under the curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24 h) or to infinity 
      (AUCinf) and the maximum concentration (Cmax) of each drug administered alone or 
      in combination. RESULTS: The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the geometric mean 
      ratio (GMR) for Cmax of luseogliflozin in the pioglitazone and miglitol studies 
      were beyond the reference range for bioequivalence (0.80-1.25) (miglitol: 0.851 
      [0.761, 0.952]; pioglitazone: 1.16 [1.04, 1.30]). However, the 90% CIs for 
      AUC0-24 h were within the reference range. The 90% CIs of the GMRs for Cmax and 
      AUC0-24 h of pioglitazone were beyond the reference range (Cmax 0.884 [0.746, 
      1.05]; AUC0-24 h 0.896 [0.774, 1.04]), but the 90% CIs for the active metabolites 
      of pioglitazone were within the reference range. For the other combinations 
      tested, the 90% CIs and GMRs for luseogliflozin and the individual OADs were 
      within the reference range. CONCLUSION: No clinically meaningful interactions 
      were observed between luseogliflozin and six commonly used OADs in Japan, 
      although there were some changes in the pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone 
      co-administered with luseogliflozin and for luseogliflozin co-administered with 
      miglitol or pioglitazone. FUNDING: Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

TI  - Assessment of the Drug Interaction Potential of Ertugliflozin With Sitagliptin, 
      Metformin, Glimepiride, or Simvastatin in Healthy Subjects.
PG  - 314-325
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.472 [doi]
AB  - Ertugliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor for the treatment of 
      adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, is expected to be coadministered with 
      sitagliptin, metformin, glimepiride, and/or simvastatin. Four separate 
      open-label, randomized, single-dose, crossover studies were conducted in healthy 
      adults to assess the potential pharmacokinetic interactions between ertugliflozin 
      15 mg and sitagliptin 100 mg (n = 12), metformin 1000 mg (n = 18), glimepiride 1 
      mg (n = 18), or simvastatin 40 mg (n = 18). Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic 
      parameters derived from plasma concentration-time data were analyzed using 
      mixed-effects models to assess interactions. Coadministration of sitagliptin, 
      metformin, glimepiride, or simvastatin with ertugliflozin had no effect on area 
      under the plasma concentration-time profile from time 0 to infinity (AUC(inf) ) 
      or maximum observed plasma concentration (C(max) ) of ertugliflozin (per standard 
      bioequivalence boundaries, 80% to 125%). Similarly, ertugliflozin did not have 
      any impact on AUC(inf) or C(max) of sitagliptin, metformin, or glimepiride. 
      AUC(inf) for simvastatin (24%) and simvastatin acid (30%) increased slightly 
      after coadministration with ertugliflozin and was not considered clinically 
      relevant. All treatments were well tolerated. The lack of clinically meaningful 
      pharmacokinetic interactions demonstrates that ertugliflozin can be 
      coadministered safely with sitagliptin, metformin, glimepiride, or simvastatin 
      without any need for dose adjustment.

TI  - Does glimepiride alter the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil citrate in diabetic 
      nephropathy animals: investigating mechanism of interaction by molecular modeling 
      studies.
PG  - 276
LID - 10.1007/s00894-015-2823-x [doi]
AB  - The present study evaluates possible drug interactions between glimepiride (GLIM) 
      and sildenafil citrate (SIL) in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic 
      nephropathic (DN) animals and also postulates the possible mechanism of 
      interaction based on molecular modeling studies. Diabetic nephropathy was induced 
      by single dose of STZ (60 mg kg(-1), i.p.) and was confirmed by assessing blood 
      and urine biochemical parameters 28 days after induction. Selected DN animals 
      were used to explore the drug interaction between GLIM (0.5 mg kg(-1), p.o.) and 
      SIL (2.5 mg kg(-1), p.o.) on the 29th and 70th day of the protocol. Possible drug 
      interaction was assessed by evaluating the plasma drug concentration using 
      HPLC-UV and changes in biochemical parameters in blood and urine were also 
      determined. The mechanism of the interaction was postulated from the results of a 
      molecular modeling study using the Maestro module of Schrodinger software. DN was 
      confirmed as there was significant alteration in blood and urine biochemical 
      parameters in STZ-treated groups. The concentration of SIL increased 
      significantly (P < 0.001) in rat plasma when co-administered with GLIM on the 
      70th day of the protocol. Molecular modeling revealed important interactions with 
      rat serum albumin and CYP2C9. GLIM has a strong hydrophobic interaction with 
      binding site residues of rat serum albumin compared to SIL, whereas for CYP2C9, 
      GLIM forms a stronger hydrogen bond than SIL with polar contacts and hydrophobic 
      interactions. The present study concludes that bioavailability of SIL increases 
      when co-administered chronically with GLIM in the management of DN animals, and 
      the mechanism is supported by molecular modeling studies.

TI  - Quantification of galantamine in human plasma by validated liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using glimepride as an internal standard: 
      application to bioavailability studies in 32 healthy Korean subjects.
PG  - 803-9
LID - 10.1093/chromsci/bms074 [doi]
AB  - A simple, rapid and selective liquid chromatography method coupled with tandem 
      mass spectrometry is developed and validated for the quantification of 
      galantamine in human plasma using a commercially available compound, glimepride, 
      as an internal standard (IS). Following simple one-step liquid-liquid extraction 
      by ethyl acetate, the analytes are separated using an isocratic mobile phase 
      consisting of acetonitrile and 0.01M ammonium acetate (95/5, v/v) on a 
      reverse-phase C18 column and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry in the multiple 
      reaction monitoring mode using the transitions of respective (M + H)(+) ions, m/z 
      288.22 → 213.20 and m/z 491.17 → 352.30 for the quantification of galantamine and 
      IS, respectively. The standard calibration curves show good linearity within the 
      range of 4 to 240 ng/mL (r(2) = 0.9996, 1/x(2) weighting). The lower limit of 
      quantification is 4 ng/mL. The retention times of galantamine and IS are 1.1 and 
      0.71 min, which showsthe high throughput potential of the proposed method. In 
      addition, no significant metabolic compounds are found to interfere with the 
      analysis. Acceptable precision and accuracy are obtained for the concentrations 
      over the standard curve range. The validated method is successfully applied for 
      pharmacokinetic and bioequivalence studies of 24 mg of a galantamine hydrobromide 
      capsule in 32 healthy Korean subjects.

TI  - Improved liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric determination and 
      pharmacokinetic study of glimepiride in human plasma.
PG  - 394-401
AB  - An improved liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric method for the 
      determination of glimepiride in human plasma has been developed and fully 
      validated. The article describes in detail the bioanalytical procedure and 
      summarizes the validation results obtained. The samples were extracted using 
      liquid--liquid extraction with a mixture of 1-chlorobutane-isopropanol-ethyl 
      acetate (88:2:10, v/v/v). The chromatographic separation was performed on a 
      reversed-phase Hypersil ODScolumn (250 x 4.6 mm i.d.; 5 microm particle size) 
      using a mobile phase consisting of formic acid 0.05 M-acetonitrile (28:72, v/v), 
      pumped at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min(-1) heated to 25 degrees C. The analytes were 
      detected using an API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with positive 
      electrospray ionization in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Tandem mass 
      spectrometric detection enabled the quantitation of glimepiride down to 0.50 ng 
      mL(-1). Calibration graphs were linear (r better than 0.998, n=1), in 
      concentration range 0.50--1000 ng mL(-1), and the intra- and inter- day RSD 
      values were less than 10.37 and 11.55% for glimepiride. The method was 
      successfully applied to a kinetic study in order to assess the main 
      pharmacokinetic parameters of glimepiride.

TI  - Overview of the Clinical Pharmacology of Ertugliflozin, a Novel Sodium-Glucose 
      Cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) Inhibitor.
PG  - 949-965
LID - 10.1007/s40262-020-00875-1 [doi]
AB  - Ertugliflozin, a selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), 
      is approved in the US, EU, and other regions for the treatment of adults with 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This review summarizes the ertugliflozin 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic data obtained during phase I clinical 
      development, which supported the registration and labeling of this drug. The PK 
      of ertugliflozin was similar in healthy subjects and patients with T2DM. Oral 
      absorption was rapid, with time to peak plasma concentrations (T(max)) occurring 
      at 1 h (fasted) and 2 h (fed) postdose. The terminal phase half-life ranged from 
      11 to 18 h and steady-state concentrations were achieved by 6 days after 
      initiating once-daily dosing. Ertugliflozin exposure increased in a 
      dose-proportional manner over the tested dose range of 0.5-300 mg. Ertugliflozin 
      is categorized as a Biopharmaceutical Classification System Class I drug with an 
      absolute bioavailability of ~ 100% under fasted conditions. Administration of the 
      ertugliflozin 15 mg commercial tablet with food resulted in no meaningful effect 
      on ertugliflozin area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), but 
      decreased peak concentrations (C(max)) by 29%. The effect on C(max) is not 
      clinically relevant and ertugliflozin can be administered without regard to food. 
      Mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment were associated with a ≤ 70% increase 
      in ertugliflozin exposure relative to subjects with normal renal function, and no 
      dose adjustment in renal impairment patients is needed based on PK results. 
      Consistent with the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors, 24-h urinary glucose 
      excretion decreased with worsening renal function. In subjects with moderate 
      hepatic impairment, a decrease in AUC (13%) relative to subjects with normal 
      hepatic function was observed and not considered clinically relevant. Concomitant 
      administration of metformin, sitagliptin, glimepiride, or simvastatin with 
      ertugliflozin did not have clinically meaningful effects on the PK of 
      ertugliflozin or the coadministered medications. Coadministration of rifampin 
      decreased ertugliflozin AUC and C(max) by 39% and 15%, respectively, and is not 
      expected to affect efficacy in a clinically meaningful manner. This comprehensive 
      evaluation supports administration to patients with T2DM without regard to 
      prandial status and with no dose adjustments for coadministration with commonly 
      prescribed drugs, or in patients with renal impairment or mild-to-moderate 
      hepatic impairment based on ertugliflozin PK.

TI  - Interaction of Organic Anion Transporter 3-Mediated Uptake of Steviol Acyl 
      Glucuronide, a Major Metabolite of Rebaudioside A, with Selected Drugs.
PG  - 1579-1587
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.9b05808 [doi]
AB  - Organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) plays a critical role in the renal excretion 
      of many xenobiotics. Because steviol acyl glucuronide (SVAG), an OAT3 substrate, 
      is the major circulating metabolite after oral ingestion of steviol glycosides 
      and is excreted into the urine, inhibition of OAT3 activity may alter 
      pharmacokinetic profiles of SVAG. The present study showed that drugs such as 
      probenecid and glimepiride displayed potent inhibition toward the OAT3-mediated 
      SVAG transport, with IC(50) values of 4.9 and 0.8 μM, respectively. No species 
      differences were observed. Probenecid and glimepiride could significantly elevate 
      plasma concentrations of SVAG after oral administration of rebaudioside A, with 
      significant increases in plasma maximum (C(max)) and area under the plasma 
      time-concentration curve values. The inhibitory effect on the OAT3-mediated SVAG 
      transport exemplified a unique case between drugs and the metabolite of a food 
      additive. Our data suggest that caution should be exercised when giving steviol 
      glycoside products to human subjects with compromised renal function.

TI  - Development and application of an analytical method for curdione quantification 
      in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats by LC-MS/MS.
PG  - 1499-505
LID - 10.1002/bmc.3449 [doi]
AB  - The vaginal administration route suffers from relatively low absorption 
      efficiency, which may hinder the identification of the toxicokinetics of curdione 
      in pregnant women. A sensitive analytical method for determining the plasma 
      concentration of curdione was developed and applied in the determination of 
      curdione in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats as a simulated model. Glimepiride was 
      used as an internal standard and chromatographic separation was achieved on a 
      Capcell Pak C18 MGIII column. A gradient elution profile with 0.5% formic acid 
      (A)-0.5% formic acid-acetonitrile (B) was selected as mobile phase. The selected 
      reaction monitoring mode was used for quantification based on the target fragment 
      ions m/z 237.2 to m/z 135.1 for curdione and m/z 491.3 to m/z 352.1 for the 
      glimepiride. The standard curve was linear over the range of 0.5-500 ng/mL for 
      curdione in rat plasma and yielded a consistent peak pattern, even at the lower 
      limit of quantitation of 0.5 ng/mL. The retention times of curdione and IS were 
      6.55 and 6.59 min, respectively. The mean recovery of curdione in rat plasma was 
      95.5-101.1%. The intra-day and inter-day precisions were between 2.35 and 9.08%. 
      This LC-MS/MS method provides a simple and sensitive means for determining the 
      plasma concentration.

TI  - Simultaneous determination of the sulphonylurea glimepiride and its metabolites 
      in human serum and urine by high-performance liquid chromatography after 
      pre-column derivatization.
PG  - 497-505
AB  - A sensitive and selective high-performance liquid chromatographic method has been 
      developed for a new sulphonylurea, glimepiride, and its metabolites. The assay 
      involves extraction with diethyl ether, thermolysis of the sulphonylureas at 100 
      degrees C and trapping of the resulting amines with 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene. The 
      derivatives were quantitated on a reversed-phase column by absorbance at 350 nm 
      using a step gradient for the three compounds in serum and an isocratic run for 
      the metabolites in urine. Analogous compounds were used as internal standards. 
      The detection limit was 5 ng/ml for glimepiride and metabolite II and 10 ng/ml 
      for metabolite I using 1 ml of serum. The method has been applied to the analysis 
      of serum and urine samples from pharmacokinetic studies in humans.

TI  - Effect of genetic polymorphisms in cytochrome p450 (CYP) 2C9 and CYP2C8 on the 
      pharmacokinetics of oral antidiabetic drugs: clinical relevance.
PG  - 1209-25
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus affects up to 8% of the adult population in Western 
      countries. Treatment of this disease with oral antidiabetic drugs is 
      characterised by considerable interindividual variability in pharmacokinetics, 
      clinical efficacy and adverse effects. Genetic factors are known to contribute to 
      individual differences in bioavailability, drug transport, metabolism and drug 
      action. Only scarce data exist on the clinical implications of this genetic 
      variability on adverse drug effects or clinical outcomes in patients taking oral 
      antidiabetics. The polymorphic enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 is the main 
      enzyme catalysing the biotransformation of sulphonylureas. Total oral clearance 
      of all studied sulphonylureas (tolbutamide, glibenclamide [glyburide], 
      glimepiride, glipizide) was only about 20% in persons with the CYP2C9*3/*3 
      genotype compared with carriers of the wild-type genotype CYP2C9*1/*1, and 
      clearance in the heterozygous carriers was between 50% and 80% of that of the 
      wild-type genotypes. For reasons not completely known, the resulting differences 
      in drug effects were much less pronounced. Nevertheless, CYP2C9 genotype-based 
      dose adjustments may reduce the incidence of adverse effects. The magnitude of 
      how doses might be adjusted can be derived from pharmacokinetic studies. The 
      meglitinide-class drug nateglinide is metabolised by CYP2C9. According to the 
      pharmacokinetic data, moderate dose adjustments based on CYP2C9 genotypes may 
      help in reducing interindividual variability in the antihyperglycaemic effects of 
      nateglinide. Repaglinide is metabolised by CYP2C8 and, according to clinical 
      studies, CYP2C8*3 carriers had higher clearance than carriers of the wild-type 
      genotypes; however, this was not consistent with in vitro data and therefore 
      further studies are needed. CYP2C8*3 is closely linked with CYP2C9*2. CYP2C8 and 
      CYP3A4 are the main enzymes catalysing biotransformation of the 
      thiazolidinediones troglitazone and pioglitazone, whereas rosiglitazone is 
      metabolised by CYP2C9 and CYP2C8. The biguanide metformin is not significantly 
      metabolised but polymorphisms in the organic cation transporter (OCT) 1 and OCT2 
      may determine its pharmacokinetic variability. In conclusion, pharmacogenetic 
      variability plays an important role in the pharmacokinetics of oral antidiabetic 
      drugs; however, to date, the impact of this variability on clinical outcomes in 
      patients is mostly unknown and prospective studies on the medical benefit of CYP 
      genotyping are required.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the novel SGLT2 inhibitor 
      ipragliflozin.
PG  - 975-88
LID - 10.1007/s40262-014-0180-z [doi]
AB  - Ipragliflozin (Suglat(®)) is a potent and selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter-2 that was recently launched in Japan. Its mechanism of action 
      involves the suppression of glucose re-absorption in the kidney proximal tubules, 
      causing excretion of glucose in the urine. The aim of this review is to provide a 
      comprehensive overview of currently available pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      data on ipragliflozin, including studies in healthy subjects, patients with type 
      2 diabetes mellitus and special populations. In single- and multiple-dose 
      studies, the maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) for ipragliflozin increased in a dose-dependent 
      manner. Although urinary excretion of ipragliflozin is low (approximately 1 %), 
      tubular concentration of free ipragliflozin is adequate to provide 
      pharmacological activities. No clinically relevant effects of age, gender or food 
      on the exposure of ipragliflozin were observed. The AUC for ipragliflozin was 
      20-30 % greater in patients with moderate renal or hepatic impairment than in 
      patients with normal renal or hepatic function. In drug-drug interaction studies, 
      the pharmacokinetics of ipragliflozin and other oral antidiabetic drugs 
      (metformin, sitagliptin, pioglitazone, glimepiride, miglitol and mitiglinide) 
      were not significantly affected by their co-administration. Urinary glucose 
      excretion (UGE) also increased in a dose-dependent manner, approaching a maximum 
      effect at 50-100 mg dosages in Japanese healthy volunteers and patients with type 
      2 diabetes. The change in UGE from baseline (ΔUGE) tended to be lower in older 
      subjects and female subjects, compared with younger subjects and male subjects, 
      respectively. ΔUGE tended to decrease with decreasing renal function, especially 
      in patients with type 2 diabetes with moderate or severe renal impairment.

AB  - In this study, the core-shell polydopamine-coated magnetic nanomaterials were 
      synthesized with one-step approach and applied as magnetic solid phase extraction 
      adsorbents combined with LCMS/MS for quantification of the diabetes drug 
      glimepiride in beagle dog plasma. The Fe(3)O(4)@PDA nanomaterials have strong 
      magnetic response, good dispersibility in aqueous solution, and numerous binding 
      sites for π-π interaction and hydrogen bonding with glimepiride. Based on these 
      merits, glimepiride could be quickly extracted and separated from plasma within 
      10min. The established method has good linearity (1-2000ng•mL(-1)), low 
      quantification limit (1ng•mL(-1)), good precision (RSDs≤12 %), and satisfactory 
      extraction recovery (71.20-85.70 %). Moreover, we successfully applied this 
      method to the bioequivalence study of generic and innovator products of 
      glimepiride in beagle dog plasma.

AB  - The present study was performed to investigate potential of Eudragit RLPO-based 
      nanosuspension of glimepiride (Biopharmaceutical Classification System class II 
      drug), for the improvement of its solubility and overall therapeutic efficacy, 
      suitable for peroral administration. Nanoprecipitation method being simple and 
      less sophisticated was optimized for the preparation of nanosuspension. 
      Physicochemical characteristics of nanosuspension in terms of size, zeta 
      potential, polydispersity index, entrapment efficiency (% EE) and in vitro drug 
      release were found within their acceptable ranges. The size of the nanoparticles 
      was most strongly affected by agitation time while % EE was more influenced by 
      the drug/polymer ratio. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction 
      studies provided evidence that enhancement in solubility of drug resulted due to 
      change in crystallinity of drug within the formulation. Stability study revealed 
      that nanosuspension was more stable at refrigerated condition with no significant 
      changes in particle size distribution, % EE, and release characteristics for 
      3 months. In vivo studies were performed on nicotinamide-streptozotocin-induced 
      diabetic rat models for pharmacokinetic and antihyperglycaemic activity. 
      Nanosuspension increased maximum plasma concentration, area under the curve, and 
      mean residence time values significantly as compared to aqueous suspension. Oral 
      glucose tolerance test and antihyperglycaemic studies demonstrated plasma glucose 
      levels were efficiently controlled in case of nanosuspension than glimepiride 
      suspension. Briefly, sustained and prolonged activity of nanosuspensions could 
      reduce dose frequency, decrease drug side effects, and improve patient 
      compliance. Therefore, glimepiride nanosuspensions can be expected to gain 
      considerable attention in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus due to its 
      improved therapeutic activity.

AB  - A rapid liquid chromatographic method with electrospray ionization tandem mass 
      spectrometric (LC-MS-MS) detection is developed and validated for quantification 
      of glimepiride in heparinized human plasma. Plasma samples, without a drying and 
      reconstitution step, are extracted by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and eluted 
      with 0.9 mL of acetonitrile-methanol (1:1, v/v) containing 0.05% formic acid. The 
      analyte and glimepiride d8 (internal standard, IS) are chromatographed on a C(18) 
      column; the mobile phase is acetonitrile-2 mm ammonium formate (88:12, v/v), with 
      the pH adjusted to 3.5 with formic acid, at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The 
      retention times of glimepiride and the IS are 0.93 min, and the runtime is 1.6 
      min per sample. Selected reaction monitoring of MH(+) at m/z 491.20 and 499.26 
      result in stable fragment ions with m/z 351.80 and 359.96 for glimepiride and the 
      IS, respectively. The response was a linear function of the concentration in the 
      range of 2.0-650.0 ng/mL, with r ≥ 0.9994. The recovery of glimepiride and the IS 
      ranged from 81.91 to 83.36%. The assay has excellent characteristics and has been 
      successfully used for the analysis of glimepiride in healthy human subjects in a 
      bioequivalence study. It was well suited to clinical studies of the drug 
      involving large numbers of samples.

AB  - Quick and specific bioanalytical methods are required for analyzing drugs in 
      biological samples. A simple, quick, sensitive, and specific UPLC-MS/MS method 
      was developed and validated for glibenclamide determination in plasma samples. 
      The plasma samples were processed by protein precipitation technique. Glimepiride 
      was used as internal standard (IS). Glibenclamide and glimepiride were eluted on 
      C18 column (Acquity UPLC®BEH). Mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile (0.1% 
      formic acid) and water (0.1% formic acid) was pumped in binary gradient mode at 
      flow rate of 150 μL/min. Glibenclamide and IS elution time was about 1.0 min, and 
      total run time was 2.0 min. The mass spectrometer (triple-quadrupole) was 
      operated in positive electrospray ionization mode. Sodium adducts [M + Na](+) of 
      glibenclamide and IS were monitored in MRM mode. A linear calibration curve was 
      obtained in the range of 10-1280 ng/mL, with regression equation Y = 0.0076 X - 
      0.0165 and linear regression coefficient r(2) = 0.999. Lower limit of 
      quantitation was 10 ng/mL. Accuracy of the method at LQC, MQC, and HQC was 109.7% 
      (± 6.7), 93.6% (± 0.4), and 99.3% (± 1.9), respectively. The coefficient of 
      variation for precision at all QC concentrations was less than 6%. Recovery at 
      LLQC, MQC, and HQC was 104.2% (± 4.9), 100.6% (± 0.9), and 102.9% (± 5.8), 
      respectively. The method was successfully implemented for pharmacokinetic 
      investigations (in-house data).

TI  - Pharmacokinetic basis for the safety of glimepiride in risk groups of NIDDM 
      patients.
PG  - 434-9
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of the sulfonylurea, glimepiride, in risk groups of NIDDM 
      patients are reviewed with regard to pharmacokinetic-effect relationships. A 
      variety of factors, such as regulatory processes, glucose absorption, insulin 
      sensitivity, might prevent the definition of a clear concentration-effect 
      relationship for sulfonylureas. However, when these processes are minimized, as 
      with the glucose clamp technique, such relationships can be defined. This is true 
      for glibenclamide or glimepiride, for which saturation of effect is apparent in 
      the upper therapeutic dose range in healthy subjects. However, 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships are less readily defined during 
      long-term treatment of NIDDM patients. In kidney or liver disease, the 
      hypoglycemic effect of sulfonylureas can be increased and prolonged, mainly due 
      to a decrease in insulin metabolism or of hepatic glucose output; the risk of 
      hypoglycemia is increased. The pharmacokinetics of most sulfonylureas have not 
      been well characterised in patients with kidney or liver disease. Generally, 
      sulfonylureas are eliminated by renal excretion of metabolites, some of which 
      have similar pharmacological activity to the parent drug e.g. glibenclamide, 
      chlorpropamide, tolbutamide. In renal disease, elimination of these metabolites 
      can be impaired. In 31 NIDDM patients with kidney disease, elimination of 
      unchanged glimepiride was greater in patients with more severe renal disease, 
      probably due to a decrease in the plasma protein-bound fraction. Elimination of 
      the renally excreted metabolites was also impaired in the same group of patients. 
      12 of 16 NIDDM patients with kidney disease who continued glimepiride treatment 
      for three months maintained fasting blood glucose levels of less than 9.99 mmol/l 
      at a daily dose of 1-6 mg, the typical dose range for patients with normal renal 
      function. Pharmacokinetic data on sulfonylureas are generally inconsistent in 
      cirrhotic patients. In 11 patients with liver disease, the pharmacokinetics of 
      glimepiride were similar to those of healthy volunteers. In conclusion, 
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and their relationships can be defined for 
      glimepiride under controlled conditions. Such information is lacking for many 
      commonly used sulfonylureas in risk group NIDDM patients. Studies described here 
      show that the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride are altered in renal disease but 
      may not be seriously affected in patients with liver disease.

PG  - 143-9
AB  - A fully automated semi-microbore high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) 
      method with column-switching using UV detection was developed for the 
      determination of glimepiride from human plasma samples. Plasma sample (900 
      microl) was deproteinated and extracted with ethanol and acetonitrile. The 
      extract (70 microl) was directly injected into a Capcell Pak MF Ph-1 pre-column 
      where the primary separation occurred to remove proteins and retain drugs using a 
      mixture of acetonitrile and 10mM phosphate buffer (pH 2.18) (20:80, v/v). The 
      analytes were transferred from the pre-column to an intermediate column using a 
      switching valve and then subsequently separated on an analytical column and 
      monitored with UV detection at 228 nm. Glimepiride was eluted with retention time 
      34.9 min without interference of endogenous substance from plasma. The limit of 
      quantification (LOQ) was 10 ng/ml for glimepiride. The calibration curves were 
      linear over the concentration range of 10-400 ng/ml (r(2) = 0.9997). Moreover, 
      inter- and intra-day precisions of the method were less than 15% and accuracies 
      were higher than 99%. The developed method was successfully applied for the 
      quantification of glimepiride in human plasma and was used to support a human 
      pharmacokinetic study following a single oral administration of 2 mg glimepiride.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to improve the solubility and bioavailability of 
      glimepiride (GLMP) by utilizing hydrotropy technique. Meglumine (MU) as a 
      hydrotrope could form the stable complex with glimepiride. The optimal 
      glimepiride and meglumine (GLMP-MU) complex powder was obtained by using 
      lyophilization. GLMP-MU powder was characterized by Fourier transform infrared 
      spectroscopy (FT IR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning 
      calorimetry (DSC). The formation of hydrogen bond between glimepiride and 
      meglumine was confirmed by FT IR. The XRD studies indicated the amorphous state 
      of glimepiride was appeared in the GLMP-MU. The DSC results were further 
      confirmed GLMP-MU complex was prepared successfully. Moreover, the in vitro drug 
      release rate of GLMP-MU powder was dramatically faster than that of glimepiride. 
      Meanwhile, the AUC of GLMP-MU solution at an i.g./or i.v. dose of 5mg/kg in rat 
      was significantly higher than that of the glimepiride suspensions. Together our 
      results showed that hydrotropy technique was a simple and effective method to 
      increase the solubility of glimepiride.

AB  - In this paper, orally nanocrystal capsules were produced using nanocrystal 
      formulations in order to optimize dissolution properties of poorly soluble drug 
      glimepiride and improve its bioavailability. The important preparation variables, 
      such as stabilizers, the power input and the time length of ultrasonication on 
      the mean particle size and polydispersity index were investigated systematically, 
      and the optimal values were 0.2% glimepiride (w/v), 1.2% Lipoid S100, 0.6% PEG 
      6000 (w/v), 0.6% PVPK 30 (w/v), 500 W and 2 min, respectively. Characterization 
      of glimepiride nanocrystal was carried out by X-ray powder diffractometry, 
      differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy. In vitro 
      dissolution test, the nanocrystal-loaded capsules of glimepiride showed an 
      evident increase in dissolution rate compared to micronized and market capsules. 
      The in vivo studies demonstrated that a marked enhancement of bioavailability of 
      nanocrystal-loaded capsules was superior compared to the marketed formulation and 
      microcrystal-loaded capsules, which may reduce the risk of side effect by 
      allowing a reduction in either the dose or its frequency of administration.

TI  - Effect of ranolazine on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes 
      treated with either glimepiride or metformin.
PG  - 463-74
LID - 10.1111/dom.12629 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To report the results of two phase III trials assessing the efficacy of 
      ranolazine for glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes on metformin or 
      glimepiride background therapy. METHODS: In two double-blind trials we randomized 
      431 and 442 patients with type 2 diabetes to ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily 
      versus placebo added to either glimepiride (glimepiride add-on study) or 
      metformin background therapy (metformin add-on study). Patients receiving 
      ranolazine added to metformin had their metformin dose halved (with the addition 
      of a metformin-matched placebo) relative to the placebo group to correct for a 
      metformin-ranolazine pharmacokinetic interaction. The primary endpoint of the 
      trials was the change from baseline in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at week 24. 
      RESULTS: When added to glimepiride, ranolazine caused a 0.51% least squares mean 
      [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71, 0.32] decrease from baseline in HbA1c at 
      24 weeks relative to placebo and roughly doubled the proportion of patients 
      achieving an HbA1c of <7% (27.1 vs 14.1%; p = 0.001). When added to metformin 
      background therapy, there was no significant difference in the 24-week HbA1c 
      change from baseline [placebo-corrected LS mean difference -0.11% (95% CI -0.31, 
      0.1)]. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, addition of ranolazine in patients 
      with type 2 diabetes treated with glimepiride, but not metformin, significantly 
      reduced HbA1c over 24 weeks. The decreased dose of metformin used in the 
      metformin add-on study complicates the interpretation of this trial. Whether an 
      effective regimen of ranolazine added to metformin for glycaemic control can be 
      identified remains unclear.

TI  - Development and Characterization of a Glimepiride-Loaded Gelatin-Coated

PG  - 369-378
LID - 10.1089/adt.2020.987 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we prepared gelatin-coated mesoporous hollow silica nanospheres 
      (GSN) as a drug carrier to improve the water solubility and regulate the release 
      rate of glimepiride (GLM). GLM was loaded into GSN by an absorption method, and 
      drug-loaded samples (GLM-GSN) were characterized by differential scanning 
      calorimeter (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Cellular uptake and in vivo 
      intestinal uptake experiments were performed in rats. In addition, the studies of 
      in-vitro drug dissolution, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic experiments also 
      were performed. GLM-GSN showed excellent drug loading (39.7% ± 0.7%) and 
      sustained GLM release. The state of GLM in GSN was amorphous according to DSC and 
      XRD results. Cellular uptake and in vivo intestinal uptake experiments indicated 
      that GSN could be effectively absorbed, and an MTT experiment demonstrated that 
      GSN had good biocompatibility. Furthermore, the GLM-GSN had a higher 
      bioavailability in pharmacokinetics experiments and a prominent hypoglycemic 
      effect on type-2 diabetes model rats in pharmacodynamic experiments. This study 
      clearly shows that GSN is a promising platform for delivering GLM for the 
      treatment of type-2 diabetes.

TI  - Determination of glimepiride in human plasma by liquid 
      chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.
PG  - 103-9
AB  - A sensitive and specific high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray 
      ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS-MS) method has been developed at 
      our center for the determination of glimepiride in human plasma. After the 
      addition of the internal standard, plasma samples were extracted by liquid-liquid 
      extraction technique using diethyl ether. The compounds were separated on a 
      prepacked C18 column using a mixture of acetonitrile, methanol and ammonium 
      acetate buffer as mobile phase. A Finnigan LCQDUO ion trap mass spectrometer 
      connected to an Alliance Waters HPLC was used to develop and validate the method. 
      The analytical method was validated according to the FDA bioanalytical method 
      validation guidance. The results were within the accepted criteria as stated in 
      the aforementioned guidance. The method was proved to be sensitive and specific 
      by testing six different plasma batches. Linearity was established for the range 
      of concentrations 5.0-500.0 ng/ml with a coefficient of determination (r2) of 
      0.9998. Accuracy for glimepiride ranged from 100.58 to 104.48% at low, mid and 
      high levels. The intra-day precision was better than 12.24%. The lower limit of 
      quantitation (LLOQ) was identifiable and reproducible at 5.0 ng/ml with a 
      precision of 7.96%. The proposed method enables the unambiguous identification 
      and quantitation of glimepiride for pharmacokinetic, bioavailability or 
      bioequivalence studies.

TI  - Comparison of the bioavailability and tolerability of fixed-dose combination 
      glimepiride/metformin 2/500-mg tablets versus separate tablets: A single-dose, 
      randomized-sequence, open-label, two-period crossover study in healthy Korean 
      volunteers.
PG  - 1408-18
LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2010.07.012 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared the bioavailability and tolerability of a 
      fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet of glimepiride/metformin 2/500 mg and 
      glimepiride 2-mg + metformin 500-mg tablets administered separately in healthy 
      Korean subjects. METHODS: In this single-dose, open-label, 2-period crossover 
      study, healthy Korean volunteers were randomly assigned to receive, in 1 of 2 
      randomized sequences, an FDC tablet of glimepiride/metformin 2/500 mg (test) and 
      glimepiride 2-mg + metformin 500-mg tablets administered separately (reference), 
      with a 1-week washout period between treatments. Plasma concentrations of 
      glimepiride and metformin were measured using LC/MS-MS. Pharmacokinetic 
      parameters were analyzed using noncompartmental methods. Bioequivalence was 
      concluded if the 90% CIs of the geometric mean test/reference ratios (GMRs) of 
      the logarithm-transformed C(max), AUC from 0 to 30 hours (AUC(0-30)), and 
      AUC(0-infinity) values were within the predetermined regulatory range of 80% to 
      125%. Tolerability was assessed using physical examination and laboratory 
      analysis. RESULTS: A total of 32 subjects were enrolled (16 men [mean (SD) age, 
      21.8 (2.7) years (range, 18-26 years); weight, 68.9 (8.3) kg (range, 55.5-85.0 
      kg)]; 16 women [age, 23.5 (4.5) years (range, 20-38 years); weight, 51.7 (3.5) kg 
      (range, 46.8-58.0 kg)]). The GMRs (90% CI) of glimepiride C(max), AUC(0-30), and 
      AUC(0-infinity) were 1.01 (0.91-1.11), 0.98 (0.92-1.03), and 0.97 (0.93-1.04), 
      respectively. For metformin, these values were 0.96 (0.87-1.06), 0.96 
      (0.90-1.03), and 0.96 (0.90-1.03). A total of 49 adverse events (AEs) were 
      reported in 10 subjects (31.3%) with the FDC and in 13 subjects (40.6%) with the 
      separate tablets. The most commonly reported AEs with the test and reference 
      treatments were dizziness (6 [19%] and 7 [22%]) and sweating (4 [13%] and 7 
      [22%]), respectively. The severity of all of the AEs was considered to be mild, 
      and there were no significant differences in the prevalences of AEs between the 2 
      formulations. CONCLUSIONS: In this study in healthy Korean subjects, the 
      requirements for bioequivalence of the glimepiride/metformin 2/500-mg FDC and 
      coadministration of separate tablets of each drug were met. Both formulations 
      were generally well tolerated.

TI  - Repaglinide has more beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk factors than 
      glimepiride: data from meal-test study.
PG  - 255-60
AB  - Aim our study is to compare the effects of repaglinide vs glimepiride 
      administration on cardiovascular risk factors after meal test. Thus, after 2 
      weeks washout period, a 3-month randomised, cross-over parallel group trial of 
      repaglinide (1 mg x 2/day) vs glimepiride (2 mg/day) in 14 patients with type 2 
      diabetes "naive" on diet treatment was made. Both treatments significantly 
      declined plasma glucose, total-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, 
      PAI-1, PAP levels and increased HDL-cholesterol. Lowering in plasma PAI-1 and PAP 
      levels was significantly greater in repaglinide group. Furthermore, repaglinide 
      administration resulted in a significant decrease in fasting plasma free fatty 
      acids, fibrinogen, thrombin-antithrombin complex and reaction product of 
      malondialdehyde with thiobarbituric acid (TBARS) levels, in absence of 
      significant difference in fasting plasma insulin levels. Decrease in plasma TBARS 
      levels correlated with the decrease in Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (r = 
      0.72; P < 0.003) and free fatty acids concentrations (r = 0.62; P < 0.01). 
      Analysis of the insulin and glucose concentrations throughout the meal test 
      revealed that AUC for glucose (758 +/- 19 vs 780 +/- 28 mg/Lxmin; P = 0.02) was 
      significantly lower after repaglinide than glimepiride administration despite 
      similar AUC for insulin (2327 +/- 269 vs 2148 +/- 292 mU/Lxmin; P = 0.105). At 
      time 120' of meal test, repaglinide vs glimepiride administration was associated 
      with a significant decline in plasma triglycerides, free fatty acids, fibrinogen, 
      Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1, plasmin-alpha(2)-antiplasmin complex, 
      thrombin-antithrombin complex, TBARS levels and increase in plasma 
      HDL-cholesterol levels. In repaglinide group a negative correlation between 
      insulin secretion during 1st phase of meal-test and plasma TBARS levels (r = 
      -0.55; P < 0.03) at time 120' was found. Such correlation was lost after 
      adjusting for changes in postprandial hyperglycaemia (r = -0.48; P < 0.09). In 
      conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that repaglinide is more efficient 
      than glimepiride on controlling for postprandial glucose excursion and may have 
      beneficial effect on reducing cardiovascular risk factors.
